Screening for testicular cancer may reduce both morbidity and mortality, yet the effectiveness of any method is unknown. Equally, screening may also promote treatment procedures that are unwarranted or may adversely affect the health outcomes of the patient with no net benefit. Additionally, many organisations recommend against screening for testicular cancer due to the low incidence of testicular cancer and favourable outcomes in the absence of screening. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to determine whether screening for testicular cancer (physician or patient self-examination) reduces testicular cancer-specific mortality. The secondary objective of this review is to determine impact of screening for testicular cancer on quality of life and adverse outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: Electronic searches were conducted across MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and PsychINFO through 9 June 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of screening versus no screening for testicular cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The search identified 19 potentially relevant articles, which were selected for full text review. None of the articles that were reviewed were evaluated as eligible for inclusion in this review. MAIN RESULTS: There are no published RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of screening for testicular cancer. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Patients with increased clinical risk factors for testicular cancer, including a family history of testicular cancer, undescended testis (cryptorchidism) or testicular atrophy should be informed by their physicians of their potential increased risk of testicular cancer, along with potential benefits and harms associated with screening.

A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to assess what published evidence is currently available to support the increasing use of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and to evaluate the published data with regard to the comparative cost of high-dose and conventional therapy. The review aimed to identify all published, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing high-dose therapy (HDT) with ASCT versus conventional chemotherapy (CC) in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and breast, lung, testicular and ovarian cancer. The review also aimed to identify all studies that had compared the cost of the two treatment strategies. Reports were identified by systematic searches of Cancerlit, Embase and Medline, and handsearching of several conference proceedings. Where possible, pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated according to the fixed-effect model. A total of 18 randomized trials were identified in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and breast, lung and testicular cancer. Trials were generally small and no disease site had sufficient information to determine reliably whether high-dose therapy with autologous transplant is more effective than CC. Five studies were identified that compared the cost of the two treatments. These found the cost of HDT to be between one and four times higher than that of CC. Further randomized trials are required. Where appropriate, these should include economic assessment and assessments of long-term toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Encouraging men to make more effective use of (preventive) health services is considered one way of improving their health. The aim of this study was to appraise the available evidence of effective interventions aimed at improving men's health. METHODS: Systematic review of relevant studies identified through 14 electronic databases and other information resources. Results were pooled within health topic and described qualitatively. RESULTS: Of 11,749 citations screened, 338 articles were assessed and 27 met our inclusion criteria. Most studies were male sex-specific, i.e. prostate cancer screening and testicular self-examination. Other topics included alcohol, cardiovascular disease, diet and physical activity, skin cancer and smoking cessation. Twenty-three interventions were effective or partially effective and 18 studies satisfied all quality criteria. CONCLUSION: Most of the existing evidence relates to male sex-specific health problems as opposed to general health concerns relevant to both men and women. There is little published evidence on how to improve men's uptake of services. We cannot conclude from this review that targeting men works better than providing services for all people. Large-scale studies are required to help produce evidence that is sufficiently robust to add to the small evidence base that currently exists in this field.

BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy in men aged 15-34, and its incidence has been increasing over the past half-century. Survival for stage I testis cancer approaches 100% regardless of management strategy which is often dictated by other factors such as perceived morbidity. Advances in treatment have attempted to decrease morbidity and surveillance is thought to achieve this goal. METHODS: An English language literature search of MEDLINE from 1966 to December 2005 and CINAHL from 1982 to December 2005 was conducted using a broad search strategy. Comparative and descriptive original articles on outcomes of seminoma or NSGCT surveillance would be deemed eligible and review articles containing no original data were omitted. One hundred and thirty-eight articles were selected for formal review, during which a database was compiled that documented the first author, publication year, tumor histologic type, study purpose or topic(s), methodology, sample size, median follow-up, and relevant results. RESULTS: Most evidence for the efficacy of surveillance is from descriptive series or non-experimental comparative studies. Relapse occurs in approximately 28% and 17% of surveillance patients in NSGCT and seminoma, respectively, and cause-specific survival is approximately 98% and 100%, respectively. Compliance with surveillance ranges from poor to adequate, however there is no evidence that compliance impacts clinical outcome. Cost analyses have yielded inconsistent results when comparing treatment modalities. There is scant literature on quality of life and psychosocial issues and results are inconsistent. Active surveillance appears to be appropriate and perhaps optimal first line management of clinical stage I seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors. Further quantitative and qualitative research is warranted to deepen understanding of these issues that may impact treatment decision-making.

The importance of cryptorchidism treatment concerns the possibility of diminishing risk of malignant degeneration and improving fertility. Success rates of hormonal treatment vary: 0-55% with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and 9-78% with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Due to uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of this treatment, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hormonal cryptorchidism treatment was done using the methodology of Cochrane Collaboration. Two studies compared hCG with GnRH, with a testicular descent rate of 25% vs. 18%, respectively. Nine trials compared intranasal LHRH with placebo, with complete testicular descent rates of 19% vs. 5%. Two other studies comparing doses and administration intervals could not be pooled together due to heterogeneity. With the information analyzed until the present, the evidence for the use of hCG vs. GnRH shows advantages for hCG, and this review also shows that there is evidence that luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) is more effective than placebo. But because this evidence is based on few trials, with small sample sizes and moderated risk of bias, this treatment cannot be recommended for everyone, and there is no evidence that supports hCG's use in larger doses and larger intervals. Results from this systematic review are important for developing better RCTs that may decrease the uncertainty of cryptorchidism treatment.

The treatment options available for the management of stage I seminoma consist of either a surveillance strategy or adjuvant therapy after orchidectomy. A systematic review was undertaken to identify the optimal management strategy. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, in addition to the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting Proceedings, were searched for the period 1981 to May 2007. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they discussed at least one of survival, recurrence, second malignancy, cardiac toxicity, or quality of life for patients with stage I seminoma. A search update was carried out in June 2009. Fifty-four reports satisfied the eligibility criteria, including seven clinical practice guidelines, one systematic review, three randomised controlled trials focused on treatment options, 26 non-randomised studies of treatment options, and 15 non-randomised long-term toxicity studies. The existing data suggest that virtually all patients with stage I testicular seminoma are cured regardless of the post-orchidectomy management. The 5-year survival reported in all the studies identified in this systematic review was over 95%, regardless of the management strategy, including surveillance alone with no adjuvant therapy. In conclusion, to date, the optimal management of stage I seminoma remains to be defined. Surveillance seems to be the preferable option, as this strategy minimises the toxicity that might be associated with adjuvant treatment, while preserving high long-term cure rates. The currently available evidence should be presented to patients in order to select the most appropriate option for the individual.

CONTEXT: The medical treatment of advanced testicular germ cell tumors has changed over the past 30 years, with long-term survival now achieved in the majority of patients. Clinicians need to be familiar with the available treatment regimens for testicular cancer and their associated toxic effects. OBJECTIVE: To review the treatments used for advanced testicular germ cell tumors and their associated short-term and long-term complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was performed of all English-language literature (1966 to October 2007) within the MEDLINE database using the terms neoplasms, germ cell, or embryonal or testicular neoplasms restricted to humans, drug therapy, complications, and mortality. The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials Databases (through October 2007) was also searched using the terms testicular cancer or germ cell tumors. Bibliographies were reviewed to extract other relevant articles. One hundred eighty-six articles were selected based on pertinence to advanced testicular cancer treatment, associated complications, and late relapses with an emphasis on randomized controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: The treatment of advanced testicular germ cell tumors with cisplatin combination chemotherapy is based on risk stratification (good, intermediate, or poor prognosis) according to pretreatment clinical features of prognostic value. Clinical trials have demonstrated that approximately 90% of patients classified as having a good prognosis achieve a durable complete remission to either 4 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin or 3 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Complete responses are achieved less frequently for patients with intermediate- and poor-risk germ cell tumors, in whom 4 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin remains the standard of care. Second- and third-line programs, including high-dose chemotherapy, also have curative potential. Chronic toxicities associated with therapy include cardiovascular disease, infertility, and secondary malignancies. Late relapses may also occur. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials have led to evidence-based treatment recommendations for advanced testicular cancer based on risk stratification. Clinicians should be familiar with the potential complications of these therapies.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the predictors of outcome in metastatic germ cell cancer (MGCC) patients treated with High-dose Chemotherapy (HDC) and stem cell rescue. BACKGROUND: Various prognostic factors have been suggested in the treatment of metastatic germ cell cancer. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation of independent prognostic factors for the efficacy of HDC in published patient cohorts. METHODS: Thirty-two published patient cohorts with MGCC (encompassing 2176 patients; 510 patients treated upfront and 1666 at relapse) were identified from PUBMED and Cochrane Registry of Clinical Trials. Weighted Regression Analyses of these trials were conducted to define prognosticators. RESULTS: Independent correlates of overall survival (OAS) when all trials were considered were line of chemotherapy index, an indicator of line of HDC utilization (1st line: 71% vs 2nd or higher line: 40%, p < 0.001), and number of HDC cycles administered (1 cycle: 43%, 1 to 2 cycles: 43%, 2 or more cycles: 64%, p = 0.021). In cohorts having HDC for relapsed disease, lower line of chemotherapy index again (p = 0.004), and higher median age (p = 0.023) were independently associated with better OAS. In trials utilizing upfront HDC, higher number of chemotherapeutics in the HDC regimen was marginally linked with improved OAS (p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of various forms of HDC in MGCC patients with diverse prognostic factors may vary both as an initial or salvage therapy. Clinicians need to be aware of these factors for optimal patient selection for HDC in MGCC (Tab. 3, Fig. 2, Ref. 54).

PURPOSE: Current indications for orchiopexy are to decrease the risk of infertility and to facilitate testicular self-examination. Although the increased risk of germ cell cancer in cryptorchid testes is undisputed, it is unclear whether orchiopexy affects the natural history of testis cancer development. We hypothesize that early orchiopexy is protective against subsequent development of testicular germ cell cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Studies pertaining to cryptorchidism and testicular cancer risk were retrieved by searching MEDLINE, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Library, using cryptorchidism as a keyword, combined with treatment, orchiopexy, testis and cancer. For data extraction exposure was dichotomized to orchiopexy before or after age 10 to 11 years, while outcome was defined as the development of testicular germ cell cancer. Summary risk measures were calculated using the random effects model. RESULTS: Four studies met our criteria. Review of all studies revealed an increased risk of testicular cancer if orchiopexy was delayed until after age 10 to 11 years or was never performed. Odds ratios ranged from 2.9 to 32.0. Meta-analysis showed that testicular cancer was nearly 6 times more likely (OR 5.8 [1.8, 19.3]) to develop in men in whom orchiopexy was delayed or was not performed, compared to those in whom it was performed early. CONCLUSIONS: Prepubertal orchiopexy may decrease the risk of testicular cancer. Thus, early surgical intervention is indicated in children with cryptorchidism. These findings suggest that the testicular environment, as well as underlying genetics, may have a role in testicular carcinogenesis.

Literature concerning sexual functioning after treatment for testicular cancer from 1975-2000 is reviewed. After a literature search in Medline and Psylit was conducted, as well as a search for cross-references made, a meta-analysis was performed. To describe sexual functioning, several aspects of the sexual response cycle were used: sexual desire, sexual arousal, erection, and orgasm; ejaculatory function, sexual activity, and sexual satisfaction were used as well. The number of patients included in the studies as well as treatment modalities were taken into account. A total of 36 relevant studies was screened (28 retrospective and 7 prospective studies), concerning 2,786 cases of testicular cancer. Meta-analysis revealed that ejaculatory dysfunction was reported most frequently and was related to surgery in the retroperitoneal area. Erectile dysfunction was related to irradiation, but was reported least frequently. Other sexual functions were not related to treatment modality. Meta-analysis revealed no deterioration of sexual functioning in the course of time, except a decrease in sexual desire and an increase in sexual satisfaction. Retrospective studies reported more sexual dysfunction than did prospective studies. Detailed analysis of separate studies, however, revealed a wide variation in reported sexual morbidity, as well as in assessment methods. Somatic consequences of disease and treatment may reduce ejaculation; however, other aspects of sexual functioning are not clearly related to disease- or treatment-related factors and may instead refer to a psychological vulnerability caused by one's confrontation with a life-threatening, genito-urinary disease, such as testicular cancer.

BACKGROUND: While cisplatin is considered superior to carboplatin for the treatment of malignant germ cell tumors (MGCTs) in adults, pediatric oncology collaborative groups still remain concerned about the late effects of cisplatin in children. METHODS: We performed a literature search to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that used carboplatin for MGCTs in adults. Since no RCTs were available in children, we identified cohort studies of pediatric MGCTs treated with carboplatin. We compared the adult and pediatric studies in terms of characteristics, doses of chemotherapy, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2,131 publications retrieved, five RCTs in adults (1,340 patients) and four cohort studies in children (219 patients) met criteria for inclusion. All adult RCTs evaluated carboplatin versus cisplatin regimens in men with good-prognosis metastatic MGCTs. Carboplatin regimens had a higher risk of events (RR 2.51, P < 0.001) and of deaths (RR 2.21, P < 0.001) than cisplatin regimens. Across all five RCTs, 497/654 (76%) of adults who received carboplatin remained event-free. Compared to the adult trials, three pediatric studies used carboplatin at a higher dose, frequency, and number of cycles. Across these three studies, 158/179 (88%) of children remained event-free. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin is superior to carboplatin at the studied doses for the treatment of adult metastatic MGCTs. However, we observe that carboplatin is associated with good outcomes for children with MGCT when used at the higher doses. We hypothesize that a risk-adapted approach utilizing both platinum agents may achieve the optimal balance between cure and late effects.

PURPOSE: Growing evidence suggests an association between higher hospital and surgeon volumes, and better outcomes after high risk surgical procedures. We reviewed the literature on volume and outcomes, specifically in urological cancer therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the literature from 1966 to 2004 using MEDLINE with the keywords outcomes, urology, neoplasms, volume, hospital volume, surgeon volume, prostatectomy, cystectomy, nephrectomy, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer and testis cancer. Relevant articles were reviewed and results were compared for each urological cancer. RESULTS: Several studies demonstrated that higher hospital volume is associated with better outcomes for all urological cancer surgeries. We found that long-term morbidity associated with radical prostatectomy is significantly associated with individual surgeon volume. There were variations in outcome even among high volume surgeons, suggesting that surgical technique can independently impact outcome. Hospitals with a high volume of cystectomies and nephrectomies had decreased overall mortality rates compared with low volume hospitals. Patients undergoing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic germ cell tumor had statistically significantly improved survival when treated at larger oncology centers. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that high volume hospitals have better outcomes is increasing for urological cancer surgeries. Whether volume affects quality or better clinicians and services attract more patients can be debated. Centralizing health care will have major health policy implications, ie high volume hospitals may be overwhelmed and low volume hospitals may be at a disadvantage. An alternative would be to attempt to improve outcomes at low volume hospitals by identifying drivers of high quality care at high volume hospitals and transferring some of these characteristics.
3eb2f3f3448ee8b5ab386e4bec6fdf60c729689a		11427781	Physical activity and cancer risk: dose-response and cancer, all sites and site-specific.	PURPOSE: The association between physical activity and overall and site-specific cancer risk is elaborated in relation to whether any observed dose-response association between physical activity and cancer can be interpreted in terms of how much physical activity (type, intensity, duration, frequency) is needed to influence site- and gender-specific cancer risk. METHODS: Observational studies were reviewed that have examined the independent effect of the volume of occupational physical activity (OPA) and/or leisure time physical activity (LPA) on overall and site-specific cancer risk. RESULTS: The evidence of cohort and case-control studies suggests that both leisure time and occupational physical activity protect against overall cancer risk, with a graded dose-response association suggested in both sexes. Confounding effects such as diet, body weight, and parity are often included as a covariate in the analyses, with little influence on the observed associations. A crude graded inverse dose-response association was observed between physical activity and colon cancer in 48 studies including 40,674 colon/colorectal cancer cases for both sexes. A dose-response effect of physical activity on colon cancer risk was especially observed, when participation in activities of at least moderate activity (>4.5 MET) and demonstrated by activities expressed as MET-hours per week. An observed inverse association with a dose-response relationship between physical activity and breast cancer was also identified in the majority of the 41 studies including 108,031 breast cancer cases. The dose-response relationship was in particular observed in case-control studies and supported by observations in cohort studies when participation in activities of at least moderate activity (>4.5 MET) and demonstrated by activities expressed by MET-hours per week. This association between physical activity and breast cancer risk is possibly dependent on age at exposure, age at diagnosis, menopausal status and other effect modifiers, e.g., body mass index. Furthermore, data concerning carcinoma of other cancers (prostate, lung, endometrium, ovary, and testicular cancers) are required. CONCLUSION: A protective effect of physical activity on site-specific cancer risk with a dose-response association between physical activity and colon and pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer supported by identified biological mechanisms has been observed. The optimal permutation of type, intensity, duration, and frequency of physical activity across the lifespan is unclear, but it is gender, age, and site specific and supports moderate activity (>4.5 MET) more than light activities (<4.5 MET). The complicated nature of the physical activity variable, combined with lack of knowledge regarding possible biological mechanisms operating between physical activity and cancer, warrants further studies including controlled clinical randomized trials.

Some large ecological studies have noted a significant association of testicular cancer (TC) with maternal smoking during pregnancy, while several more controlled studies have been negative. It has been difficult to obtain reliable data on exposure because of the long lag time to cancer diagnosis. We performed a case-control study nested within Finnish, Swedish and Icelandic maternity cohorts exploiting early pregnancy serum samples to evaluate the role of maternal smoking in the risk of TC in the offspring. After reviewing the literature, we also performed a meta-analysis of published studies. For each index mother of the TC patient, three to nine matched control mothers with a cancer-free son born at the same time as the TC case were identified within each cohort. First trimester sera were retrieved from the 70 index mothers and 519 control mothers and were tested for cotinine level by a novel HPLC-MS-MS method developed. No statistically significant association between maternal cotinine level and risk of TC in the offspring was found (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.35, 1.34). This is the first study based on individual exposure measurements. Its results agree with our meta-analysis of seven previous epidemiological studies (total number of 2149 cases, 2762 controls) using indirect exposure assessment (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.88, 1.12).

OBJECTIVE: Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) is a new technique for identifying different malignant tumors using different uptake values between tumor cells and normal tissues. Here we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET in patients with testicular cancer by pooling data of existing trials in a meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Trials databases were searched and studies published in English relating to the diagnostic value of FDG-PET for testicular cancer were collected. The summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was used to examine the FDG-PET accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies which included 957 examinations in 807 patients (median age, 31.1 years) were analyzed. A meta-analysis was performed to combine the sensitivity and specificity and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), from diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), positive likelihood ratios (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR). SROC were derived to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET for testicular cancer. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70-0.80) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89), respectively. The pooled DOR was 35.6 (95% CI, 12.9-98.3). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.88. The pooled PLR and pooled NLR were 7.80 (95% CI, 3.73-16.3) and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.23-0.43), respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with testicular cancer, 18F-FDG-PET demonstrated a high SROC area, and could be a potentially useful tool if combined with other imaging methods such as MRI and CT. Nevertheless, the literature focusing on the use of 18F-FDG-PET in this setting still remains limited.

Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are characterized by young age of onset and a complex pattern of histological subtypes. Transcriptomic studies have tried to uncover the gene expression patterns underlying this. Here, we present a systematic review of transcriptome studies of TGCTs of adolescents and young adults and identify genes common across the various studies, both for TGCTs in general as well as the histological subtypes, hence elucidating both transcriptional changes associated with malignant transformation and differentiation patterns. A meta-analysis of this type adds power and significance to the genes thus found, where most studies have included only a limited number of samples. Both known (KRAS, MYCN and TPD52) and novel (CCT6A, IGFBP3 and SALL2) cancer genes are implicated in TGC tumorigenesis. Gene expression patterns characteristic to embryonic stem cells are also found deregulated in TGC tumorigenesis. This is reflected in how pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells commonly differentiate into a variety of embryonic and extra-embryonic histological types, each with unique transcriptomes. The embryonal carcinomas in particular are found to overexpress pluripotency genes, while gene signatures for seminomas, teratomas and yolk sac tumours were also identified. This underlines the distinctive transcriptomic programme across histological subtypes, especially striking given that the TGCT genome is largely similar across the same subtypes.

CONTEXT: Germ cell tumours (GCTs) of the testis are the most common cancer in young men; they are also one of the most curable cancers. Standard treatment of metastatic GCTs has evolved on the basis of randomised trials and prognostic factors. OBJECTIVE: This review summarises the evolving role of chemotherapy in the treatment of previously treated and untreated patients with metastatic GCTs and outlines the current standard treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Randomised and nonrandomised trials of first-line, salvage, and palliative therapy were reviewed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Three cycles of standard bleomycin, etoposide, and platinum (BEP) can be considered the gold-standard treatment in good-risk patients, and four cycles of the same combination can result in cure in approximately 80% of intermediate-risk and 50% of poor-risk patients. The routine use of high-dose chemotherapy in patients with intermediate- or poor-prognosis GCT has not improved treatment outcome, but the role of tumour marker decline during the first cycles may provide useful prognostic information. Prognostic variables in patients who experience treatment failure after cisplatin-based chemotherapy can be used to guide salvage strategies, and many new drugs or combinations have shown activity in this setting. Patients and physicians should be aware of the risk of short- and long-term toxicity of treatments, and guidelines for screening and prevention of this risk should be established. CONCLUSIONS: A risk-based strategy offers the best chance of cure, even in patients with refractory GCT.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Bilateral testicular germ cell tumours (BTGCTs) are rare neoplasms. Most previously published studies consist of case reports or small retrospective case series. Little is known about their epidemiological and clinicopathological characteristics. BTGCT corresponded to 1.82% of testicular tumours. Metachronous disease was about twice as frequent as synchronous disease. The primary tumour histology, chemotherapy use and the interval between metachronous tumours influenced the histology of the second tumour. Overall, synchronous tumours were associated with more advanced disease and presented less favourable survival rates than metachronous tumours. Testicular cancer is the most common tumour in young men. It is known that a second primary contralateral testis tumour may occur in up to 5% of men with a proior tumour. About 35% of these men present with synchronous tumours, and 65% present with metachronous tumours. However there is little data about bilateral testicular germ cell tumours (BTGCT) in the literature and the most published articles are case reports on a small series of men, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about therapeutic strategies for the treatment of BTGCTs. In fact, current guidelines for the treatment of testicular cancer contain little information related to bilateral disease. Therefore, the aim of our study is to provide a broad overview of BTGCT and to update data focusing on incidence, pathological features, and clinical outcomes of men with BTGCTs. Thus, an extensive review containing 94 studies and more than 50,000 patients was conducted.

BACKGROUND: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of perinatal variables in relation to testicular cancer risk, with a specific focus upon characteristics of the son. METHODS: Literature databases Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed and Web of Science were searched using highly sensitive search strategies. Of 5865 references retrieved, 67 articles met the inclusion criteria, each of which was included in at least one perinatal analysis. RESULTS: Random effects meta-analysis produced the following results for association with testicular cancer risk: birth weight [per kilogram, odds ratio (OR) = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.01, I(2)= 12%], low birth weight (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.67, I(2)= 51%), high birth weight (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.96-1.14, I(2)= 0%), gestational age (per week, OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98, I(2)= 38%; low vs not, OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.59, I(2)= 49%), cryptorchidism (OR = 4.30, 95% CI 3.62-5.11, I(2)= 44%), inguinal hernia (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.37-1.94, I(2)= 38%) and twinning (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.44, I(2)= 22%). Meta-analyses of the variables birth length, breastfeeding and neonatal jaundice did not provide evidence for an association with testicular cancer risk. When low birth weight was stratified by data ascertainment (record/registry vs self-report), only the category of self-report was indicative of an association. Meta-regression of data ascertainment (record/registry vs self-report) inferred that record-/registry-based studies were less supportive of an association with gestational age (per week = 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-1.00, I(2)( )= 29%; low vs not = 1.08, 95% CI 0.91-1.28, I(2)= 32%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis finds evidence that cryptorchidism, inguinal hernia and twinning, and tentative evidence that birth weight and gestational age, are associated with risk of testicular cancer.

CONTEXT: According to current guidelines, radical orchidectomy is the standard treatment for testis tumours of malignant and unknown origin. Testis-sparing surgery (TSS) has recently been proposed as an alternative option in selected cases. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyse the cumulative evidence for TSS in the treatment of adult malignant tumours of different histology, including notes on operative technique, indications, complications, and oncologic and functional outcome. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search of the Medline/PubMed database for full-length papers reporting on TSS for adult malignant tumours was performed up to September 2009. Bibliographies of retrieved articles and review articles were also examined. Only those articles with complete data on operative technique, complications, and oncologic or functional outcome were selected. Furthermore, published abstracts at major urologic meetings in the last decade (1999-2009) and guidelines on testis cancer from major oncologic and urologic medical associations were searched and evaluated. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: No randomised controlled trials have compared TSS and radical orchidectomy; only retrospective outcome studies and case reports on TSS are available. In patients with small malignant germ cell tumours arising in both or in solitary testes, TSS coupled with local adjuvant radiotherapy ensures good oncologic control and is associated with a preserved endocrine function in most cases. In patients with small Leydig cell tumours, TSS can also be performed with elective indications (healthy contralateral testes), provided that pathology fails to reveal aggressive features. Finally, TSS is an option for patients with small ultrasound-detected, nonpalpable tumours even with elective indications because the incidence of benign definitive histology is high at approximately 80%. The overall complication rate is low (<6%). Data on exocrine and endocrine gonadal function, male body image, and health-related quality of life after TSS are still immature. CONCLUSIONS: TSS can be safely adopted for the treatment of carefully selected cases of tumours of different histology. Prospective multicentre studies are warranted to further qualify TSS as a treatment option to be recommended as an alternative to radical orchidectomy and to explore the perceived functional advantages of testis preservation.

BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the relationships of anthropometry and testicular germ-cell tumour (TGCT) have reported heterogeneous findings. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between adult height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and testicular cancer. Search strategies were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science on 26 May 2009. Studies that met our inclusion criteria were included in meta-analytic models using STATA 11. RESULTS: A total of 3255 references were retrieved, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analysis found adult height (odds ratio (OR) per 5-cm increase 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19, P<0.001) and weight (OR overweight vs normal 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98, P=0.011) to be associated with TGCT. The meta-analysis of weight and TGCT produced a summary estimate, which indicated no association, although an analysis restricted studies to North American was suggestive of association (OR per 1-kg increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has found evidence for a positive association of adult height and TGCT, and tentative evidence for an inverse association of BMI and TGCT.

OBJECTIVES: To date a number of studies have examined the association between maternal weight and testicular cancer risk although results have been largely inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the nature of this association. METHODS: Search strategies were conducted in Ovid Medline (1950-2009), Embase (1980-2009), Web of Science (1970-2009), and CINAHL (1937-2009) using keywords for maternal weight (BMI) and testicular cancer. RESULTS: The literature search produced 1689 hits from which 63 papers were extracted. Only 7 studies met the pre-defined criteria. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted. The combined unadjusted OR (95% CI) of testicular cancer in the highest reported category of maternal BMI compared with the moderate maternal BMI was 0.82 (0.65-1.02). The Cochran's Q P value was 0.82 and the corresponding I(2) was 0%, both indicating very little variability among studies. The combined unadjusted OR (95% CI) for testicular cancer risk in the lowest reported category of maternal BMI compared to a moderate maternal BMI category was 0.88 (0.65-1.20). The Cochran's Q P value was 0.05 and the corresponding I(2) was 54%, indicating evidence of statistical heterogeneity. The combined unadjusted OR (95% CI) of testicular cancer risk per unit increase in maternal BMI was 1.01 (0.97-1.06). The Cochran's Q test had a P value of 0.05 and the corresponding I(2) was 55% indicating evidence of statistical heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis, which included a small number of studies, showed that a higher maternal weight does not increase the risk of testicular cancer in male offspring. Though an inverse association between high maternal BMI and testicular cancer risk was detected, it was not statistically significant. Further primary studies with adjustment for appropriate confounders are required.

BACKGROUND: There is an increasing body of literature associating testicular microlithiasis (TM), a common finding on testicular ultrasound, with testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) and intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type (ITGCNU). Determining these associations is pertinent both clinically and biologically. To the authors' knowledge, no previous systematic review or meta-analysis has been performed. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature review was performed without language restrictions through July 2009 and included an exhaustive search of electronic databases and article references. Two reviewers extracted data independently. Studies were categorized according to the clinical context in which sonography was performed. The primary study outcomes were concurrent diagnoses of TGCT or ITGCNU, with TM. In addition, studies with prospective follow-up of patients with TM were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies met inclusion criteria. TM was not associated with an increased risk of TGCT in asymptomatic men. However, in referral populations, TM was associated overall with a risk ratio of 8.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-16.1; P<.001) for a concurrent diagnosis of TGCT and 10.5 (95% CI, 5.3-20.8; P<.0001) for ITGCNU. Seventeen observational studies were identified in which the interval development of TGCT in patients with TM was reported; however, the majority of those studies did not report the follow-up of a control arm and could not be summarized. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of risk factors, TM was associated with a substantially elevated risk of a concurrent diagnosis of TGCT and ITGCNU. The authors suggest modifications to recently proposed guidelines for the management of TM.

After orchidectomy and staging, patients with clinical stage I (CS I) non-seminomatous testicular cancer (NSTC) may be offered chemotherapy, surgery or active surveillance. The optimal postoperative approach is undefined. Therefore, a systematic review was carried out to assess these management approaches. Eligible studies, systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines included patients with CS I NSTC or a mixed seminoma/non-seminoma diagnosis. The primary outcomes of interest included cancer cure, long-term toxicity and quality of life. In total, 32 unique reports met the selection criteria. Cancer cure rates were excellent regardless of the management option selected. Overall and disease-free survival rates were over 95% for all management approaches; recurrence rates were higher in the patients managed by surveillance. In conclusion, patients with CS I NSTC should be assessed and managed at multidisciplinary centres by health care professionals experienced in the treatment of testicular cancer. On the basis of the available evidence, the Genitourinary Disease Site Group recommended primary surveillance for all patients with CS I NSTC, with treatment if relapse occurs. As cancer cure rates are similar with primary surveillance, adjuvant chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, patient preference with respect to the risk of recurrence and the timing and toxicities of treatment must be considered. For patients who prefer immediate treatment, or who are unsuitable for primary surveillance, adjuvant chemotherapy with two cycles of bleomycin, etoposide (500mg/m(2)/cycle) and cisplatin was recommended. Surgeons involved in the development of this guideline suggested that retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy may be a useful option for patients at high risk of relapse. There is currently insufficient evidence from prospective trials to support or refute this position.

BACKGROUND: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of perinatal variables in relation to testicular cancer risk, with a specific focus upon characteristics of the mother. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched using sensitive search strategies. Meta-analysis was undertaken using STATA 10. RESULTS: A total of 5865 references were retrieved, of which 67 met the inclusion criteria and contributed data to at least one perinatal analysis. Random effects meta-analysis found maternal bleeding during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.73], birth order (primiparous vs not, 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16; second vs first, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-0.99; third vs first, OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.01; fourth vs first, OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.94) and sibship size (2 vs 1, OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75-1.15; 3 vs 1, OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74-1.07; 4 vs 1, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90) to be associated with testicular cancer risk. Meta-analyses that produced summary estimates which indicated no association included maternal age, maternal nausea, maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, breech delivery and caesarean section. Meta-regression provided evidence that continent of study is important in the relationship between caesarean section and testicular cancer (P = 0.035), and a meta-analysis restricted to the three studies from the USA was suggestive of association (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.07-2.56). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has found evidence for associations of maternal bleeding, birth order, sibship size and possibly caesarean section with risk of testicular cancer.

We aimed to evaluate the current role of the two treatment modalities in this setting of testicular seminoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis (MA) was carried out to identify all evaluable studies. Search was limited to studies published after 1990 and included the Medline, Embase databases, and abstracts from ASCO (GU), ESMO, AUA, and ASTRO meetings up to April 2014. Sensitivity analyses were applied including the following: CSIIA and CSIIB, paraortic + iliac RT only in both stages, RT dose (≥30 versus <30 Gy), and PEB/EP regimens only. RESULTS: Thirteen studies have been selected for MA on relapse outcome. No randomized trials compared RT and CT. There were 4 prospective and 9 retrospective studies, with a total of 607 patients receiving RT and 283 patients CT. The pooled relapse rate (RR) was similar between the RT [0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.14, P for heterogeneity = 0.096, I(2) = 38%] and CT groups (0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.15, P for heterogeneity <0.001, I(2) = 82.5%). However, in the sensitivity analysis, the pooled RR for RT in CSIIB was 0.12 (95% CI 0.06-0.17) while it was 0.05 (95% CI 0-0.11) for CT. Long-term side-effects and incidence of second cancers were more frequently reported following RT. The overall incidence of nontesticular second malignancies was 0.04 (95% CI 0.01-0.02) in the RT group and 0.02 (95% CI 0.003-0.04) in the CT group. CONCLUSIONS: Although RT and CT appeared to be equal options in CSIIA and IIB seminoma, a trend in favor of CT for a lower incidence of side-effects and RR in CSIIB was found. This evidence is limited by the retrospective quality of studies and their small sample size.

Clinical epidemiology is sometimes called the basic science of clinical medicine. In terms of the pathogenesis of testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs), clinical epidemiology analyzes suspected risk factors. The present review highlights the risk factors established so far and briefly summarizes those factors currently under investigation. In analogy to the methods of evidence based medicine, this review attributes levels of evidence to each of the putative risk factors. Level I represents highest quality of evidence while level V denotes the lowest level. So far, undescended testis (UDT), contralateral testicular GCT and familial testis cancer are established risk factors attaining high levels of evidence (levels I-III a). In a meta-analysis of 21 studies exploring the association of UDT with GCT risk, an over-all relative risk (RR) of 4.8 (95% confidence interval 4.0-5.7) was found. Contralateral testicular GCT involves a roughly 25-fold increased RR of GCT, while familial testis cancer constitutes a RR of 3-10. Infertility, testicular atrophy, and twin-ship represent risk factors with lesser levels of evidence (level III a). There is also some evidence for HIV infection being a predisposing factor for GCT (level IV a). Scrotal trauma is probably not associated with GCT risk. The estrogen excess theory implies high estrogen levels during the first trimester of pregnancy. As a consequence, primordial germ cells lose track of the normal developmental line and transform into premalignant cells that later become testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN), the precursor of full-blown testicular GCT. Surrogate parameters for high gestational estrogen levels are investigated in case control studies. Such factors are maternal age >30 years, first-born, low birth weight, maternal breast cancer, high sex-ratio of siblings. So far, the sum of evidence is promising but still conflicting (especially for level III b). Another novel theory is the childhood nutrition hypothesis. This concept postulates a modulating or "catalyzing" effect by high dietary intake during childhood on the pathogenesis of testicular GCT. A surrogate parameter of early childhood nutrition is adult height. So far, 12 controlled studies have looked to the possible association of attained height and GCT risk of which six demonstrated a significant association. Thus, the sum of evidence corresponds to level III b. This concept is appealing because it would explain several hitherto unexplained epidemiological features of GCT.

Little is known about the clinical value of FDG PET for assessing treatment response in pediatric oncology. After systematic review of literature, the very few publications concerning response control in pediatric oncology using FDG PET are summarized. There were only 4 studies concerning FDG PET in the assessment of therapy response in pediatric patients. None of the publications fulfilled the requirements for high quality studies because of the small number of patients studied. The clinical value of FDG PET in the assessment of therapy response in pediatric oncology is likely in osseous sarcomas and possibly in high-grade brain tumors. In other pediatric tumor entities such as lymphomas, soft-tissue sarcomas, germ cell tumors, or neuroblastomas, the clinical usefulness of FDG PET can either be assumed analogous to adults, or can be assumed from staging studies, or is still unknown. There is a need for large, systematic studies evaluating FDG PET in therapy monitoring, but also in grading, staging, and in the diagnosis of recurrences in pediatric malignancies.

It has been suggested that breast milk may play a role in the prevention of certain childhood cancers. We undertook a systematic review of published studies investigating the association between breast-feeding and childhood cancers using Medline (1966 to June 2004), supplemented with auto alerts and manual searches. Analyses are based on odds ratios for specific cancers among those ever breast-fed compared with those never breast-fed, pooled using random-effects models. Forty-nine publications were potentially relevant; of these, 26 provided odds ratio estimates for at least one childhood cancer outcome and were included in metaanalyses. Overall, 92% of the studies were case-control studies, 85% relied on long-term recall of feeding history, only 8% examined breast-feeding exclusivity and control response rates were under 80% in over half. Metaanalyses suggested lower risks associated with having been breast-fed of 9% (95% CI = 2-16%) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 24% (3-40%) for Hodgkin's disease and 41% (22-56%) for neuroblastoma, with little between-study heterogeneity. The estimates for Hodgkin's disease and neuroblastoma, however, were driven by single studies. There was little evidence that breast-feeding was associated with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, central nervous system cancers, malignant germ cell tumors, juvenile bone tumors, or other solid cancers. In conclusion, ever having been breast-fed is inversely associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and neuroblastoma in childhood, but noncausal explanations are possible. Even if causal, the public health importance of these associations may be small. Our estimates suggest that increasing breast-feeding from 50% to 100% would prevent at most 5% of cases of childhood acute leukemia or lymphoma. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

CONTEXT: On behalf of the European Association of Urology (EAU), guidelines for the diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up of testicular cancer were established. OBJECTIVE: This article is a short version of the EAU testicular cancer guidelines and summarises the main conclusions from the guidelines on the management of testicular cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Guidelines were compiled by a multidisciplinary guidelines working group. A systematic review was carried out using Medline and Embase, also taking Cochrane evidence and data from the European Germ Cell Cancer Consensus Group into consideration. A panel of experts weighted the references, and a level of evidence and grade of recommendation were assigned. RESULTS: There is a paucity of literature especially regarding longer term follow-up, and results from a number of ongoing trials are awaited. The choice of treatment centre is of the utmost importance, and treatment in reference centres within clinical trials, especially for poor-prognosis nonseminomatous germ cell tumours, provides better outcomes. For patients with clinical stage I seminoma, based on recently published data on long-term toxicity, adjuvant radiotherapy is no longer recommended as first-line adjuvant treatment. The TNM classification 2009 is recommended. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines contain information for the standardised management of patients with testicular cancer based on the latest scientific insights. Cure rates are generally excellent, but because testicular cancer mainly affects men in their third or fourth decade of life, treatment effects on fertility require careful counselling of patients, and treatment must be tailored taking individual circumstances and patient preferences into account. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Although testicular cancer has excellent cure rates, the choice of treatment centre is of the utmost importance. Expert centres achieve better results for both early stage testicular cancer (lower relapse rates) and overall survival (higher stages within clinical trials). For patients with clinical stage I seminoma, adjuvant radiotherapy is no longer recommended as first-line adjuvant treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) is the precursor lesion for invasive testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) of adolescents and young adults. The rising incidence of these tumors has prompted a rigorous investigation of the etiology, diagnosis and management of ITGCN. Bilateral testicular cancer is closely linked with ITGCN, as patients with unilateral testicular cancer are at the highest risk for a future malignancy in the contralateral testicle. METHODS: A literature review directed at ITGCN and bilateral testis cancer was performed using the Medline/PubMed database. Our review focused on the pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment regimens utilized. RESULTS: Major advances have been made in the understanding of ITGCN over the past 30 years. There is evidence that TGCTs arise from ITGCN, ITGCN is closely related to fetal gonocytes, and that events in pre- and perinatal period may result in abnormal persistence of fetal gonocytes leading to ITGCN and subsequent TGCT. Controversy exists regarding the need to biopsy men at increased risk of TGCT, as well as the best approach to managing patients with known ITGCN. Bilateral testicular cancer has excellent outcomes in the current era of platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The optimal management of patients at risk for ITGCN and future TGCT is still a matter of debate. Individualization of management, including biopsy and treatment, should be based on risk factors for TGCT, compliance with potential surveillance, and patient preferences particularly with regard to fertility.

Testicular cancer is the most frequent malignant disorder in men aged 15-35 years. Generally, diagnosing and follow-up include computer tomography (CT) examinations to detect possible retroperitoneal spread (abdomen and pelvis), resulting in at least eight CT examinations. This patient group is thereby exposed to a non-neglectable radiation dose, increasing the risk of future radiation-induced secondary cancer. This is especially problematic in potentially surgically cured patients with stage 1 testicular cancer. Thus, it can be beneficial to substitute CT with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provided there is valid evidence that the diagnostic value of MRI is at least comparable to current multislice CT (MSCT). The purpose of this study was to analyze whether there is evidence to recommend a substitution of MSCT with MRI in the diagnosis of retroperitoneal spread of testicular cancer. A literature search on the diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of MSCT and MRI in the diagnosis of retroperitoneal spread of testicular cancer was performed in the following databases: PubMed, EmBase, and ISI Web of Science. The search was limited to include the period from 2000 to September 2008, and to human and English-language publications. Forty-four publications were obtained for formal review (27 from PubMed, 15 from EmBase, two from ISI Web of Science). None of the publications reviewed encompassed diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of MSCT, and they lacked systematic comparison of MSCT and MRI. Only one study included sensitivity and specificity of MRI compared to single-slice CT. Both methods had a sensitivity and a specificity of approximately 70%. The literature review did not reveal valid data regarding diagnostic accuracy of MRI compared with MSCT for diagnosing retroperitoneal spread of testicular cancer. A prospective blinded comparative study is needed to provide valid evidence.

PURPOSE: We sought to discuss the indications for reoperative retroperitoneal surgery, preoperative evaluation of patients, distribution of retroperitoneal recurrences and technical considerations for reoperative procedures. In addition, the histologic findings, clinical outcomes and perioperative complications were reviewed. METHODS: A PubMED and Medline search was performed to identify reoperative retroperitoneal surgery series for patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. RESULTS: A reliance on cisplatin-based chemotherapy to treat residual disease after RPLND is inadequate for most patients. If retroperitoneal failure does occur, reoperative RPLND should be considered as the recurrence can harbor viable GCT or teratoma, which both necessitate surgical excision. The left para-aortic and left renal hilar regions are the most common sites of retroperitoneal failure. Reoperative retroperitoneal surgery can be performed with an acceptable morbidity as long as surgeons are equipped to handle significant intraoperative complications. Clinical outcomes after reoperative RPLND are influenced by serum tumor markers, histologic findings and completeness of surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival rates in men requiring redo RPLND appear significantly lower than similar patients who are successfully treated with their initial RPLND. Given the potential complexity of this operation and its impact on a patient's prognosis, reoperative RPLND surgery should be limited to specialized quaternary care centers.
89c0781d4985aa3436f5e7ed59c35855d5fba6bb		9298346	The clinical value of lactate dehydrogenase in serum: a quantitative review.	The aim of this article is to describe guidelines for rational use of lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzymes, in the diagnostic processes and during follow-up, based on a systematic review of relevant literature. Sources of data for this study were English-language scientific publications, obtained from the database of the National Library of Medicine (Medline), concerning the clinical application (diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of disease) of lactate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme measurements in serum in the following main clinical fields: cardiology, hepatology, haematology and oncology. For acceptance in the present review, studies had to include: a proper definition of the tested patient population, diagnostic criteria, sampling time, sampling frequency, and test characteristics. Estimation of the relation between lactate dehydrogenase or lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes and specific diseases expressed as sensitivity, specificity, survival or remission rate were extracted. The application of serum lactate dehydrogenase is relevant in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (late detection), haemolytic anaemia, ovarian dysgerminoma and testicular germ cell tumor. For monitoring the progress of a disease lactate dehydrogenase is relevant in establishing the survival duration and rate in Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and in the follow-up of ovarian dysgerminoma. Rational use of lactate dehydrogenase can be achieved when requests for its determination are limited to the above mentioned conditions. No rationale could be found for measuring lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.

Testicular cancer is one of the greatest threats to health and wellness among 15- to 40-year old males. A concerted effort in the literature promoting awareness, risk factors, and preventative measures is warranted. There is limited discussion on the validity of interventions aimed at promoting testicular self-examination (TSE) performance; the existing body of evidence offers little discussion on what specific factors motivate performance. To assist in making Healthy People 2020 an all-inclusive success, a comprehensive assessment of existing evidence is necessary to assist in closing this research gap. A systematic review of interventions promoting TSE performance discovered moderate levels of effectiveness among 10 studies promoting the behavior. Concerning methodological quality, nine were of average quality and one was of high quality. In terms of significant TSE reporting between intervention and control/comparison groups, 3 out of 10 did not achieve the statistical causal threshold. Based on our assessment of TSE intervention quality and outcomes pertaining to behavior adoption, a best-practices guideline is presented for researchers in the field to consult as they design their interventions. This guideline aims to improve on internal and external validity of TSE promotion research in order to make them more effective.

Purpose: Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common solid organ malignancy in young men. It is a largely curable disease, so the extent to which it affects quality of life-including male fertility-is important. Abnormal semen analysis is highly predictive of male infertility. We conducted a systematic review of published studies that reported pre-orchiectomy semen parameters (as a surrogate for fertility) in TGCT patients to evaluate the association between TGCT and semen abnormalities before orchiectomy. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications reporting semen parameters before orchiectomy in adult patients diagnosed with TGCT. Further, we assessed the association between TGCT and semen abnormalities that may lead to infertility. Results: We applied MeSH search terms to four online databases (PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, Web of Science, and Ovid), resulting in 701 potentially relevant citations. After conducting a three-stage screening process, six articles were included in the systematic review. For each study, the participants' data and the study's quality and risk of bias were assessed and described. All studies showed semen abnormalities-including count, motility, and morphology-in men with TGCT prior to orchiectomy. Conclusions: TGCT is associated with semen abnormalities before orchiectomy. This review shows an increase in abnormal semen parameters among men with TGCT even outside the treatment effects of orchiectomy, radiation, or chemotherapy. To improve long-term quality of life, these findings should be considered when counseling patients on future fertility and sperm banking during discussions about treatment and prognosis for TGCT.

BACKGROUND: Similarities between the age-specific incidence pattern of testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) and the age-specific incidence pattern of cancers of viral origin prompted us to evaluate the relationship between common infections occurring during childhood or young adult life and TGCT using existing data from the US Servicemen's Testicular Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants (STEED) case-control study. METHODS: TGCT cases diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 (n=767) were matched on age, race and serum draw date to at least one control (n=929). RESULTS: None of the infections evaluated were associated with TGCT risk. Further, a meta-analysis of mumps and mumps orchitis or orchitis infection did not support an association with TGCT (mumps pooled odds ratio (OR): 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-1.20; mumps orchitis or orchitis pooled OR: 1.80, 95% CI: 0.74-4.42). CONCLUSION: Based on our evaluation of childhood and early life infections and meta-analyses of mumps and mumps orchitis and/or orchitis, TGCT does not appear to be associated with common childhood infections.

Testicular cancer is a rare disease, affecting mainly young men aged 15-49. There have been some recent reports that it might be associated with radiation exposure. We have systematically reviewed this topic. English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008 studying the relationship between occupational radiation exposure and testicular cancer were included. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the EPHPP checklist. For ionising radiation we subdivided study populations into occupational groups. No pooled analysis was performed due to the heterogeneity of studies. Seven case-control and 30 cohort studies were included in the review. For radiation workers, one incidence study showed a significant increase and four showed no effect. Eight mortality studies did not indicate an effect while four showed a non-significant increase. Incidence among persons with military exposure was not increased in two studies and non-significantly increased in another two. Among aircrew studies, one showed no effect against five with slight increases. Medical exposure studies showed no increases. For EMF exposure, three studies showed no effect, two reported a significant and four a non-significant increase in incidence. Overall, there was very limited evidence for associations between occupational ionising radiation and testicular cancer, while there were some positive associations for EMF. Testicular cancer mortality is generally low and was not associated with radiation. New incidence studies are recommended to investigate the association between radiation exposure and testicular cancer where exposure is better specified and individually estimated.
f00be3a7cd2fdab31e2818d91108421167989c94	10.1093/annonc/mdt425	24276027	A meta-analysis of patient outcomes with subcentimeter disease after chemotherapy for metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumor.	BACKGROUND: Approximately a quarter of men with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) have a residual mass, typically in the retroperitoneum, after chemotherapy. The management of small residual masses (≤1 cm) is controversial, with good outcomes seen with either post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) or surveillance. We sought to review our experience of surveillance and synthesize the cumulative findings with the current literature in the form of a meta-analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE and abstracts from ASCO and AUA to identify relevant, English-language studies for the meta-analysis. The DFCI (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) database was constructed from a database of men undergoing cisplatin-based chemotherapy for metastatic NSGCT. The outcomes of interest were the proportion with necrosis, teratoma or active cancer on histology at PC-RPLND (literature) and the total number of relapses, RP-only relapses and overall survival in men undergoing surveillance (literature and DFCI cohort). RESULTS: Three of 47 men undergoing post-chemotherapy surveillance at our institution relapsed over a median follow-up of 5.4 years. All three were alive at a median of 4.2 years after relapse. On meta-analysis, the pooled estimates of necrosis, teratoma and active cancer in the 588 men who underwent PC-RPLND were 71, 24 and 4%, respectively. Of the combined 455 men who underwent surveillance, the pooled estimate of the relapse rate was 5%, with an RP-only relapse rate of 3%. Of the 15 men who suffered an RP-only relapse on surveillance, two died of disease. CONCLUSION: Surveillance is a reasonable strategy for men with minimal residual RP disease after chemotherapy and avoids an RPLND in ∼97% of men who are cured with chemotherapy alone.

The only quantitative summary estimate of the link between prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents and testicular cancer was published over 10 years ago; other reviews of the link between estrogenic compounds, other than the potent pharmaceutical estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES), and TDS end points have remained inconclusive. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of the association between the end points related to TDS and prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents. Inclusion in this analysis was based on mechanistic criteria, and the plausibility of an estrogen receptor (ER)-α-mediated mode of action was specifically explored. Eight studies were included, investigating the etiology of hypospadias and/or cryptorchidism that had not been identified in previous systematic reviews. Four additional studies of pharmaceutical estrogens yielded a statistically significant updated summary estimate for testicular cancer. Results of the subset analyses point to the existence of unidentified sources of heterogeneity between studies or within the study population.(AU)

Background:It is unclear whether more timely cancer diagnosis brings favourable outcomes, with much of the previous evidence, in some cancers, being equivocal. We set out to determine whether there is an association between time to diagnosis, treatment and clinical outcomes, across all cancers for symptomatic presentations.Methods:Systematic review of the literature and narrative synthesis.Results:We included 177 articles reporting 209 studies. These studies varied in study design, the time intervals assessed and the outcomes reported. Study quality was variable, with a small number of higher-quality studies. Heterogeneity precluded definitive findings. The cancers with more reports of an association between shorter times to diagnosis and more favourable outcomes were breast, colorectal, head and neck, testicular and melanoma.Conclusions:This is the first review encompassing many cancer types, and we have demonstrated those cancers in which more evidence of an association between shorter times to diagnosis and more favourable outcomes exists, and where it is lacking. We believe that it is reasonable to assume that efforts to expedite the diagnosis of symptomatic cancer are likely to have benefits for patients in terms of improved survival, earlier-stage diagnosis and improved quality of life, although these benefits vary between cancers.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 3 March 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.48 www.bjcancer.com.

Approximately 18 million Americans are current marijuana users. There is currently no consensus on whether marijuana use is associated with cancer risk. Our objective is to review the epidemiologic studies on this possible association. We identified 34 epidemiologic studies on upper aerodigestive tract cancers (n= 11), lung cancer (n= 6), testicular cancer (n=3), childhood cancers (n=6), all cancers (n=1), anal cancer (n = 1), penile cancer (n = 1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2), malignant primary gliomas (n = 1), bladder cancer (n = 1), and Kaposi sarcoma (n = 1). Studies on head and neck cancer reported increased and decreased risks, possibly because there is no association, or because risks differ by human papillomavirus status or geographic differences. The lung cancer studies largely appear not to support an association with marijuana use, possibly because of the smaller amounts of marijuana regularly smoked compared with tobacco. Three testicular cancer case-control studies reported increased risks with marijuana use [summary ORs, 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-2.23 for higher frequency and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.09) for (greater-than or equal to)10 years]. For other cancer sites, there is still insufficient data to make any conclusions. Considering that marijuana use may change due to legalization, well-designed studies on marijuana use and cancer are warranted.

We aimed to update the current evidence on the role of RT and CT in this setting of advanced seminoma. Material & Methods: A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify all studies reporting on results of RT or CT in CSIIA and CSIIB seminoma. Search was limited to studies published after 1990 and included the Medline, Embase databases, and abstracts from ASCO (GU), ESMO, AUA, and ASTRO meetings up to 02/2014. A systematic review and meta-analysis (MA) was performed. Sensitivity analyses were applied by independently analyzing the effect of treatment in these subgroups: CSIIA and CSIIB, paraortic+iliac RT only in both stages, RT dose ((greater-than or equal to)30 Gy vs <30 Gy), and PEB/EP regimens only. A meta-regression model was also applied. Results: 13 studies have been selected for MA on relapse-free survival (RFS). No randomized trials compared RT and CT. There were 6 prospective and 7 retrospective studies, with a total of 527 patients receiving RT and 317 receiving CT. The pooled relapse-rate (RR) was similar between the RT (9%, 95% CI: 7-11, p for heterogeneity = 0.24, I-square = 22%, with 10 studies included) and CT groups (8%, 95% CI: 2-15, p for heterogeneity <0.001, I-square = 81%, with 7 studies included). Furthermore, the slope of the regression to evaluate the effect of CT respect to RT on RFS risk did not result significantly different from zero (-0.46, 95% CI: -3.80 to 2.27, p=0.772). The outcome was similar across the clinical stages and treatment modalities. Of note however, the pooled RR for RT in CSIIB was 14% (95% CI, 9-18) while it was 8% (95% CI, 2-15) for CT. For OS endpoint, 9 studies were available and the pooled mortality rate was similar using RT (1%, 95% CI: 0.2-2, p for heterogeneity = 0.57, I-square = 0%,) or CT (1%, 95% CI: 0.2-2, p for heterogeneity = 0.37, I-square = 6%, with 5 studies included). Long-term side-effects and incidence of second cancers were more frequently reported following RT. The overall incidence of nontesticular second malignancies was 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02-0.05) in the RT group and 0.02 (95% CI: 0.003-0.04) in the CT group. Conclusions: Although RT and CT appeared to be equal options in CSIIA and IIB seminoma, a trend in favour of CT for a lower incidence of side effects and relapse rate in CSIIB was found. This evidence is limited by the retrospective quality of studies and their small sample size. Prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm the findings in CSIIB.

OBJECTIVE: Testicular stage I seminoma has a remarkable cure rate with orchiectomy alone. The benefit of adjuvant therapy is questionable, and a direct comparison with active surveillance is lacking. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy (CT) compared with surveillance alone on relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and noncancer-related mortality in patients with stage I seminoma. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. Meta-analysis was performed using the fixed- or random-effects models. The primary endpoint was 5-year RFS, and secondary endpoints were 5-year OS and 5-year noncancer-related mortality, reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 13 trials (11 retrospective and 2 prospective cohort series), including 12,075 patients with stage I seminoma, were analyzed. The relapse rates were 3.9% versus 14.8% in the adjuvant therapy and surveillance arms, respectively. Overall, adjuvant therapy significantly improved 5-year RFS (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.1-0.29; P < .00001), but not 5-year OS (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.46-2.28; P = .94). Mortality due to other causes was not significantly increased with CT or RT. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant RT and CT reduce recurrence risk by 80% of stage I seminoma. However, they do not increase OS or noncancer-related mortality. Both treatment options can be offered to patients with stage I seminoma, taking into consideration the side effects and high cure rate of testicular cancer at relapse.

PURPOSE: There are many recent observational studies on testicular microlithiasis (TM) and risk of testicular cancer. Whether TM increases the risk of testicular cancer is still inconclusive. The objective of this updated meta-analysis was to synthesize evidence from clinical observational studies that evaluated the association between TM and testicular cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified eligible studies by searching the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library before March 2014. Adjusted relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-or fixed-model. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies involving 35,578 participants were included in the meta-analysis. On the basis of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale systematic review, eleven studies were identified as relatively high-quality. TM was strong association with an increased incidence of testicular cancer (RR = 12.70, 95% CI: 8.18-19.71, P < .001), with significant evidence of heterogeneity among these studies (P for heterogeneity < .001, I2 = 82.1%). The subgroup and sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the results and no publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests that TM is significantly associated with risk of testicular cancer. More researches are warranted to clarify an understanding of the association between TM and risk of testicular cancer.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) provide the strongest evidence to justify interventions in patients. However, trials with inadequate methods are associated with bias and exaggerated treatment effects. A search of the literature was conducted to review RCTs in testicular cancer (TC) to assess demographic and trial reporting quality patterns over time. METHODS: MEDLINE and CENTRAL were queried for TC RCTs from 1989 to 2014. Demographic information was abstracted and reporting quality score was evaluated using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials criteria. Linear regression was used to assess the trend in reporting quality over time. RESULTS: A total of 39 RCTs were identified, of which 25 were published from 1989 to 2001 and 14 were published from 2002 to 2014. Most (59%) of the RCTs involved chemotherapy as the intervention, had a medical oncologist as the first author (87%), and took place in Europe (59%). RCTs published between 2002 and 2014 had longer enrollment periods (mean = 6.1 [2.7] vs. 3.7 [1.5] years, P = 0.007), whereas the number of patients randomized, median follow-up, or time from manuscript submission to acceptance were not significantly different between the periods. For each increasing year of publication, there was a significant improvement of 1.34% points (95% CI: 0.86-1.83, P<0.0001) in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials score. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer RCTs in TC were published in the recent 13-year period. Although the quality of trial reporting improved compared with the preceding 13-year period, deficiencies remain. Urologists can play an important role in trial design, recruitment, and execution, and ensuring trial methodology and reporting quality is prioritized.

OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (L-RPLND) was introduced over 20 years ago as a less invasive alternative to open node dissection. In this review we summarise the indications, surgical technique and outcomes of L-RPLND in the treatment of testicular cancer. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE using the terms 'laparoscopy', 'laparoscopic', 'retroperitoneal lymph node dissection', 'RPLND' and 'testicular neoplasms'. Articles were selected on the basis of their relevance, study design and content, with an emphasis on more recent data. RESULTS: We found 14 pertinent studies, which included >1300 patients who received either L-RPLND (515) or open RPLND (788). L-RPLND was associated with longer mean operative times (204 vs. 186 min), but shorter hospital stays (3.3 vs. 6.6 days) and lower complication rates (15.6% vs. 33%). Oncological outcomes were similar between L-RPLND and open RPLND, with local relapse rates of 1.3% and 1.4%, incidence of distal progression of 3.3% and 6.1%, biochemical failure in 0.9% and 1.1% and cure rates of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: There are no randomised controlled studies comparing L-RPLND with open RPLND. A review of case and comparative series showed similar perioperative and oncological outcomes. Patients undergoing L-RPLND on average have shorter hospital stays, a quicker return to normal activity and improved cosmesis.

BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer is primarily treated with the surgical removal of the affected testis. About 50 % of testicular cancer patients present with a stage I seminoma. If no chemo- or radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment is initiated after orchiectomy, 15-20 % of these patients will develop metastases. Although adjuvant treatment is effective in reducing the relapse risk, there is rising concern about overtreatment of these patients. Prognostic factors at primary diagnosis might have the potential to identify patients at higher risk of tumor relapse, allowing to guide individual therapy and to avoid overtreatment. Therefore, we aim to synthesize the available evidence on tumor or patient characteristics as possible prognostic factors for cancer recurrence in patients with clinical stage I seminoma. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a broad systematic review to analyze what prognostic factors predict cancer recurrence in patients with a first time diagnosis of clinical stage I seminoma, who received no adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy after orchiectomy. The literature search will comprise MEDLINE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Urologic Association (AUA), and European Urologic Association (EAU) Annual Meetings. Prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies reporting on prognostic factors for cancer recurrence will be considered. We will consider the wealth of any candidate clinical or pathological prognostic factor reported in the literature. Our outcome of interest will be tumor recurrence at a minimum of 2 years follow-up. Study screening, data extraction, and quality assessment will be done by two reviewers independently. Hazard ratios will be used to measure the relationship between the potential prognostic factor and tumor recurrence. Meta-analyses will be conducted with sufficiently homogeneous studies and separately with respect to study design, by using the random-effects generic inverse variance model. DISCUSSION: Limitations and strengths will be discussed in our review, and the results will be put into context with other studies in this field. Our results will help to guide evidence-based decision-making on patients with clinical stage I seminoma, allowing a better adjustment of therapies with regard to the individual patient's risk. Our findings will furthermore help to formulate recommendations for future research. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42014009434.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise empirical evidence gathered from studies that (a) explored men's knowledge, awareness, and attitudes toward testicular cancer (TC) and its screening; (b) addressed their testicular self-examination (TSE) practice; and/or (c) highlighted barriers and facilitators to this practice. . DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE®, CINAHL®, and EMBASE®. . DATA SYNTHESIS: 25 articles met the inclusion criteria. Knowledge deficits regarding TC and its screening were seen. Participants who did not perform TSE often were uninformed about this practice. The majority of men perceived TC education as a positive step toward raising awareness about this malignancy. . CONCLUSIONS: Very few men were informed about TC and TSE. Future studies should include valid and reliable tools to assess TC knowledge and screening, address the means through which TC knowledge is delivered, explore the individual's experience with TC screening, and focus on TC awareness and screening among minority groups. . IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Although regular screening for TC is a controversial issue, nurses should encourage young men to seek medical attention in the event of discovering scrotal abnormalities.
