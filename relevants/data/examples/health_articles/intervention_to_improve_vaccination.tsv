OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the literature to examine HIV vaccine acceptability and factors impacting acceptability of future HIV vaccines. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of peer-reviewed articles that assessed HIV vaccine acceptability. METHODS: We used a comprehensive search strategy across multiple electronic databases to locate original quantitative or qualitative studies that examined rates or correlates of HIV vaccine acceptability. We conducted meta-analysis on studies reporting correlates or predictors of HIV vaccine acceptability. RESULTS: Twenty studies (n=7576) reported HIV vaccine acceptability ranging from 37.2 to 94.0 on a 100-point scale; weighted mean acceptability =65.6 (SD=21.1). Eleven studies compared HIV vaccine acceptability at high (80-95%) efficacy (mean =73.8; SD=9.2) versus moderate (50%) efficacy (mean =40.4; SD=20.2). Among 13 studies (n=5023) included in meta-analysis, efficacy and non 'risk group' membership had medium effect sizes, and pragmatic obstacles, cost, perceived susceptibility to HIV infection, side effects/safety concerns, fear of vaccines, perceived vaccine benefits, duration of protection, and ethnicity had small effect sizes on HIV vaccine acceptability. CONCLUSION: Public health strategies to promote the benefits of partial efficacy HIV vaccines and accurate HIV risk perceptions, and to dispel vaccine fears, along with structural interventions to subsidize vaccine costs and facilitate access, may increase future HIV vaccine uptake and, in turn, the effectiveness of HIV vaccines in controlling the epidemic.
96ba61b0b11447cce1c7d61e0ab3da68c81501b3		8930856	A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials to evaluate computer-based clinical reminder systems for preventive care in the ambulatory setting.	OBJECTIVE: Computer-based reminder systems have the potential to change physician and patient behaviors and to improve patient outcomes. We performed a meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials to assess the overall effectiveness of computer-based reminder systems in ambulatory settings directed at preventive care. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches of the Medline (1966-1994), Nursing and Allied Health (1982-1994), and Health Planning and Administration (1975-1994) databases identified 16 randomized, controlled trials of computer-based reminder systems in ambulatory settings. STATISTICAL METHODS: A weighted mixed effects model regression analysis was used to estimate intervention effects for computer and manual reminder systems for six classes of preventive practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adjusted odds ratio for preventive practices. RESULTS: Computer reminders improved preventive practices compared with the control condition for vaccinations (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.39-4.00), breast cancer screening (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.44-2.45), colorectal cancer screening (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.74-2.91), and cardiovascular risk reduction (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.55-2.61) but not cervical cancer screening (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.89-1.49) or other preventive care (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.79-1.32). For all six classes of preventive practices combined the adjusted OR was 1.77 (95% CI 1.38-2.27). CONCLUSION: Evidence from randomized controlled studies supports the effectiveness of data-driven computer-based reminder systems to improve prevention services in the ambulatory care setting.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effective of audit and feedback (A&amp;F) on immunization delivery by health care professionals. DESIGN: Systematic review of published literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in immunization rates. METHODS: We searched Medline between 1966 and 1997. We obtained additional studies from back-searching reference lists and the files of study collaborators. We included studies that were written in English, that included audit and feedback in at least one arm of the study, that studied universally recommended childhood or adult vaccines, and that provided immunization coverage data. Two reviewers read studies independently and abstracted using a validated checklist. Study quality was assessed using criteria standardized by the Cochrane Collaboration. Differences between reviewers were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: The search process resulted in 60 citations; 44 were fully reviewed and 15 met eligibility criteria. Five were randomized trials. Twelve of the fifteen studies found that A&amp;F, alone or in combination with other interventions, were associated with improvements in immunization rates. The magnitude of the effect varied from -17% to +49% change. Study design heterogeneity precluded statistical pooling of study results. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence available from published studies suggests that A&amp;F alone may be an effective strategy for improving immunization rates. The number of well-conducted studies is small, and the effect is variable. Additional well-designed studies are needed to identify the independent effects of A&amp;F, optimal format and frequency of A&amp;F, and to examine its long-term effect on provider immunization practices and costs.
89ef0af3f27f217d46a58d32244a443bdc5bccef		7987755	Evaluation of the effectiveness of immunization delivery methods.	Scientific evidence documenting the effectiveness of immunization delivery methods was summarized using the generic approach developed by the Community Health Practice Guidelines Working Group. The delivery methods examined were those for the adult and childhood vaccines of influenza, pneumococcal infection, hepatitis B, measles-mumps-rubella and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-polio. Based on a critical appraisal of 54 eligible comparative studies, the effects of different interventions were obtained and pooled effects were calculated for delivery methods oriented to the client, the provider and the system. The results indicate those interventions found to be most effective for each vaccine. This review of the scientific evidence of the effectiveness of immunization delivery methods provides a base for policy development and assists in the planning of resource allocation.

There are many examples in the US, and the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) for general practitioners (GPs) in the UK is an example of a major system-wide reform. Despite the popularity of these schemes, there is currently little rigorous evidence of their success in improving the quality of primary health care, or of whether such an approach is cost-effective relative to other ways to improve the quality of care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to examine the effect of changes in the method and level of payment on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians (PCPs) and to identify: i)&#160;the different types of financial incentives that have improved quality; ii)&#160;the characteristics of patient populations for whom quality of care has been improved by financial incentives; and iii)&#160;the characteristics of PCPs who have responded to financial incentives. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychLIT, and ECONLIT. Searches of Internet-based economics and health economics working paper collections were also conducted. Finally, studies were identified through the reference lists of retrieved articles, websites of key organisations, and from direct contact with key authors in the field. Articles were included if they were published from 2000 to August 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA), and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating the impact of different financial interventions on the quality of&#160;care delivered by primary healthcare physicians (PCPs). Quality of care was defined as patient reported outcome measures, clinical behaviours, and intermediate clinical and physiological measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality, in consultation with two other review authors where there was disagreement. For each included study, we reported the estimated effect sizes and confidence intervals. MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies were included in this review. Three of the studies evaluated single-threshold target payments, one examined a fixed fee per patient achieving a specified outcome, one study evaluated payments based on the relative ranking of medical groups&#8217; performance (tournament-based pay), one study examined a mix of tournament-based pay and threshold payments, and one study evaluated changing from a blended payments scheme to salaried payment.&#160;Three cluster RCTs examined smoking cessation; one CBA examined patients' assessment of the quality of care; one CBA examined cervical screening, mammography screening, and HbA1c; one ITS focused on four outcomes in diabetes; and one controlled ITS (a difference-in-difference design) examined cervical screening, mammography screening, HbA1c, childhood immunisation, chlamydia screening, and appropriate asthma medication. Six of the seven studies showed positive but modest effects on quality of care for some primary outcome measures, but not all. One study found no effect on quality of care. Poor study design led to substantial risk of bias in most studies. In particular, none of the studies addressed issues of selection bias as a result of the ability of primary care physicians to select into or out of the incentive scheme or health plan. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of financial incentives to reward PCPs for improving the quality of primary healthcare services is growing. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of financial incentives to improve the quality of primary health care. Implementation should proceed with caution and incentive schemes should be more carefully designed before implementation. In addition to basing incentive design more on theory, there is a large literature discussing experiences with these schemes that can be used to draw out a number of lessons that can be learned and that could be used to influence or modify the design of incentive schemes. More rigorous study designs need to be used to account for the selection of physicians into incentive schemes. The use of instrumental variable techniques should be considered to assist with the identification of treatment effects in the presence of selection bias and other sources of unobserved heterogeneity. In randomised trials, care must be taken in using the correct unit of analysis and more attention should be paid to blinding. Studies should also examine the potential unintended consequences of incentive schemes by having a stronger theoretical basis, including a broader range of outcomes, and conducting more extensive subgroup analysis. Studies should more consistently describe i) the type of payment scheme at baseline or in the control group, ii) how payments to medical groups were used and distributed within the groups, and iii) the size of the new payments as a percentage of total revenue. Further research comparing the relative costs and effects of financial incentives with other behaviour change interventions is also required.

BACKGROUND: We reviewed published and unpublished studies of mass mailings designed to increase utilization of influenza vaccine among Medicare beneficiaries. METHODS: Search of computerized indexes for published studies and the Medicare Peer Review Organization Health Care Quality Improvement Project database for unpublished studies. Study selection criteria were: use of a controlled trial design and use of mass mailings direct to Medicare beneficiaries to increase receipt of influenza vaccinations. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate by physician reviewers with consensus resolution. RESULTS: Six controlled trials of mass mailings were identified. One study, published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), reported a modest but statistically significant improvement in influenza vaccination rates among patients who received a letter relative to those who did not. This study was cited as justification for mail interventions performed in five subsequent studies, none of which reported clinically meaningful results. None of these five studies was published. CONCLUSIONS: Mass mailings have at best had clinically trivial effects on increasing influenza vaccination among Medicare beneficiaries. Publication bias has contributed to continued use of a relatively ineffective intervention.

Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of LHW interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of LHW interventions in primary and community health care on maternal and child health and the management of infectious diseases. SEARCH STRATEGY: For the current version of this review we searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (including citations uploaded from the EPOC and the CCRG registers) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1 Online) (searched 18 February 2009); MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 to February Week 1 2009) (searched 17 February 2009); MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid (February 13 2009) (searched 17 February 2009); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to 2009 Week 05) (searched 18 February 2009); AMED, Ovid (1985 to February 2009) (searched 19 February 2009); British Nursing Index and Archive, Ovid (1985 to February 2009) (searched 17 February 2009); CINAHL, Ebsco 1981 to present (searched 07 February 2010); POPLINE (searched 25 February 2009); WHOLIS (searched 16 April 2009); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (1975 to present) (searched 10 August 2006 and 10 February 2010). We also searched the reference lists of all included papers and relevant reviews, and contacted study authors and researchers in the field for additional papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of any intervention delivered by LHWs (paid or voluntary) in primary or community health care and intended to improve maternal or child health or the management of infectious diseases. A 'lay health worker' was defined as any health worker carrying out functions related to healthcare delivery, trained in some way in the context of the intervention, and having no formal professional or paraprofessional certificate or tertiary education degree. There were no restrictions on care recipients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form and assessed risk of bias. Studies that compared broadly similar types of interventions were grouped together. Where feasible, the study results were combined and an overall estimate of effect obtained. MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. These showed considerable diversity in the targeted health issue and the aims, content, and outcomes of interventions. The majority were conducted in high income countries (n = 55) but many of these focused on low income and minority populations. The diversity of included studies limited meta-analysis to outcomes for four study groups. These analyses found evidence of moderate quality of the effectiveness of LHWs in promoting immunisation childhood uptake (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.37; P = 0.0004); promoting initiation of breastfeeding (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.61; P &lt; 0.00001), any breastfeeding (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.39; P = 0.0004), and exclusive breastfeeding (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.74 to 4.44; P &lt;0.0001); and improving pulmonary TB cure rates (RR 1.22 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) P &lt;0.0001), when compared to usual care. There was moderate quality evidence that LHW support had little or no effect on TB preventive treatment completion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; P = 0.99). There was also low quality evidence that LHWs may reduce child morbidity (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03) and child (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.03; P = 0.07) and neonatal (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; P = 0.07) mortality, and increase the likelihood of seeking care for childhood illness (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.05; P = 0.20). For other health issues, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions regarding effectiveness, or to enable the identification of specific LHW training or intervention strategies likely to be most effective. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LHWs provide promising benefits in promoting immunisation uptake and breastfeeding, improving TB treatment outcomes, and reducing child morbidity and mortality when compared to usual care. For other health issues, evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effects of LHWs.
f85bf3964da0ae57f96b05d7dbb09725373624b4	10.1002/14651858.CD003941.pub2	16034918	Patient reminder and recall systems to improve immunization rates	BACKGROUND: Immunization rates for children and adults are rising, but coverage levels have not reached optimal goals. As a result of low immunization rates, vaccine-preventable diseases still occur. In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules, rising expectations about the performance of primary care, and large demands on primary care physicians, it is important to understand and promote interventions that work in primary care settings to increase immunization coverage. A common theme across immunization programs in all nations involves the challenge of determining the denominator of eligible recipients (e.g. all children who should receive the measles vaccine), and identifying the best strategy to ensure high vaccination rates. Strategies have focused on patient-oriented interventions (e.g. patient reminders), provider interventions, and system interventions. One intervention strategy involves patient reminder and recall systems. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of patient reminder and recall systems in improving immunization rates, and compare the effects of various types of reminders in different settings or patient populations. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search was performed for the initial review using MEDLINE (1966-1998) and 4 other bibliographic databases: EMBASE, PsychINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and CAB Abstracts. Authors also performed a search of The Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) register in April 2001 to update the review. Two authors reviewed the lists of titles and abstracts, and used the inclusion criteria to mark potentially relevant articles for full review. The reference lists of all relevant articles and reviews were back searched for additional studies. Publications of abstracts, proceedings from scientific meetings, and files of study collaborators were also searched for references. In May 2007 the EPOC register was searched to identify relevant articles to update the review. In May 2007, the EPOC register search was supplemented by searches of CINAHL and PubMed. One study was identified through prior knowledge of this study. SELECTION CRITERIA: Study Design Randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies written in English. Types of participants Health care personnel who deliver immunizations and children (birth to 18 years) or adults (18 years and up) who receive immunizations in any setting. Types of interventions Any intervention that falls within the EPOC scope and that includes patient reminder or recall systems, or both, in at least one arm of the study. Types of outcome measures Immunization rates, or the proportion of the target population up-to-date on recommended immunizations. Outcomes were acceptable for either individual vaccinations (e.g. influenza vaccination) or standard combinations of recommended vaccinations (e.g. all recommended vaccinations by a specific date or age). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data Collection Each study was read independently by two reviewers. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by a formal reconciliation process to achieve consensus. Analysis Results are presented for individual studies as relative rates for randomized controlled trials, and as absolute changes in percentage points for controlled before and after studies. Pooled results for RCTs only were for presented using the random effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Four new studies were added for the 2007 update for a total of 47 studies. Increases in immunization rates due to reminders were in the range of 1 to 20 percentage points. Reminders were effective for childhood vaccinations (OR = 1.47, 95% CI =1.28, 1.68), childhood influenza vaccinations (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.29, 3.70), adult pneumococcus, tetanus, and Hepatitis B (OR = 2.19, 95%CI = 1.21, 3.99), and adult influenza vaccinations (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.31, 2.09). The effectiveness of patient reminders for childhood influenza vaccinations declined overall from an odds ratio of 2.87 in the previous review. However, reminders were not effective in the one new study of adolescent immunizations in an urban setting (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.98, 1.31). All types of reminders were effective (postcards, letters, telephone or autodialer calls), with telephone being the most effective but also the most costly. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Patient reminder and recall systems in primary care settings are effective in improving immunization rates in developed countries.

BACKGROUND: Globally, immunization services have been the center of renewed interest with increased funding to improve services, acceleration of the introduction of new vaccines, and the development of a health systems approach to improve vaccine delivery. Much of the credit for the increased attention is due to the work of the GAVI Alliance and to new funding streams. If routine immunization programs are to take full advantage of the newly available resources, managers need to understand the range of proven strategies and approaches to deliver vaccines to reduce the incidence of diseases. In this paper, we present strategies that may be used at the sub-national level to improve routine immunization programs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies and projects reported in the published and gray literature. Each paper that met our inclusion criteria was rated based on methodological rigor and data were systematically abstracted. Routine-immunization - specific papers with a methodological rigor rating of greater than 60% and with conclusive results were reported. RESULTS: Greater than 11,000 papers were identified, of which 60 met our inclusion criteria and 25 papers were reported. Papers were grouped into four strategy approaches: bringing immunizations closer to communities (n = 11), using information dissemination to increase demand for vaccination (n = 3), changing practices in fixed sites (n = 4), and using innovative management practices (n = 7). CONCLUSION: Immunization programs are at a historical crossroads in terms of developing new funding streams, introducing new vaccines, and responding to the global interest in the health systems approach to improving immunization delivery. However, to complement this, actual service delivery needs to be strengthened and program managers must be aware of proven strategies. Much was learned from the 25 papers, such as the use of non-health workers to provide numerous services at the community level. However it was startling to see how few papers were identified and in particular how few were of strong scientific quality. Further well-designed and well-conducted scientific research is warranted. Proposed areas of additional research include integration of additional services with immunization delivery, collaboration of immunization programs with new partners, best approaches to new vaccine introduction, and how to improve service delivery.

OBJECTIVES: Lay health workers (LHWs) are used in many settings to increase immunisation uptake among children. However, little is known about the effectiveness of these interventions. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of LHW interventions on childhood immunisation uptake. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index and Archive, AMED, POPLINE and WHOLIS, reference lists of included papers and relevant reviews, and contacted the authors of relevant papers. We selected randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series of any intervention delivered by LHWs and designed to increase childhood immunisation uptake. Two authors independently extracted data using a standard form and assessed risk of bias and evidence quality. FINDINGS: We identified twelve studies, ten of which were randomised controlled trials. Seven studies were conducted among economically disadvantaged populations in high-income countries. Five studies were from low- and middle-income countries. In ten studies, LHWs promoted childhood immunisation. In two studies, LHWs vaccinated children themselves. In most of the studies, the control group populations received no intervention or standard care. Most of the studies showed that LHWs increased immunisation coverage. However, study settings were diverse, allowing us to carry out only one meta-analysis including four studies. CONCLUSION: LHWs could make an important contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goal for child health. However, more high-quality studies are needed, particularly from LMICs. More studies are also needed to assess the effects of using LHWs to vaccinate children themselves.

A systematic literature review identified 44 RCTs testing interventions to increase influenza vaccination rates among seniors >or=60. Case-control and cohort studies were excluded after review because of problems identifying secular trends and unknown confounders. Because of heterogeneity and unique interventions tested by a single or a few RCTs few studies could be pooled in meta-analysis. Using the CDC classification of interventions: (1) Increasing community demand: there is evidence of low quality that reminders increase influenza vaccination rates; (2) Increasing access: there is evidence of moderate quality that home visits to those >or=60 promoting influenza vaccination increase rates, and (3) Provider- and system-based interventions: there is evidence of moderate quality that facilitators working to improve preventive interventions in practices increase rates.

BACKGROUND: In Canada, vaccination coverage for seasonal influenza among health care personnel remains below 50%. The objective of this review was to determine which seasonal influenza vaccination campaign or campaign components in health care settings were significantly associated with increases in influenza vaccination among staff. METHODS: We identified articles in eight electronic databases and included randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies and studies with interrupted time series designs in our review. Two reviewers independently abstracted the data and assessed the risk of biases. We calculated risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for randomized controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies and described interrupted time series studies. RESULTS: We identified 99 studies evaluating influenza vaccination campaigns for health care workers, but only 12 of the studies were eligible for review. In nonhospital health care settings, including long-term care facilities, campaigns with a greater variety of components (including education or promotion, better access to vaccines, legislation or regulation and/or role models) were associated with higher risk ratios (i.e, favouring the intervention group). Within hospital settings, the results reported for various types of campaigns were mixed. Many of the criteria for assessing risk of bias were not reported. INTERPRETATION: Campaigns involving only education or promotion resulted in minimal changes in vaccination rates. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate components and combinations of components in influenza vaccination campaigns for health care personnel.
9ea9d22a47b7afbf73f6fe1d0cff0d874f200a43		11025835	Effect of patient reminder/recall interventions on immunization rates: A review.	CONTEXT: Immunization rates for children and adults remain below national goals. While experts recommend that health care professionals remind patients of needed immunizations, few practitioners actually use reminders. Little is known about the effectiveness of reminders in different settings or patient populations. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of patient reminder systems in improving immunization rates, and to compare the effectiveness of different types of reminders for a variety of patient populations. DATA SOURCES: A search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and CAB Health Abstracts. Relevant articles, as well as published abstracts, conference proceedings, and files of study collaborators, were searched for relevant references. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language studies involving patient reminder/recall interventions (using criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration) were eligible for review if they involved randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, or interrupted time series, and measured immunization rates. Of 109 studies identified, 41 met eligibility criteria. Studies were reviewed independently by 2 reviewers using a standardized checklist. Results of studies are expressed as absolute percentage-point changes in immunization rates and as odds ratios (ORs). Studies with similar characteristics of patients or interventions were pooled (random effects model). DATA SYNTHESIS: Patient reminder systems were effective in improving immunization rates in 33 (80%) of the 41 studies, irrespective of baseline immunization rates, patient age, setting, or vaccination type. Increases in immunization rates due to reminders ranged from 5 to 20 percentage points. Reminders were effective for childhood vaccinations (OR, 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-2.72), childhood influenza vaccinations (OR, 4. 25; 95% CI, 2.10-8.60), adult pneumococcus or tetanus vaccinations (OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.21-21.78), and adult influenza vaccinations (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.69-3.10). While reminders were most effective in academic settings (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.98-5.58), they were also highly effective in private practice settings (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1. 45-2.22) and public health clinics (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.42-3.07). All types of reminders were effective (postcards, letters, and telephone or autodialer calls), with telephone reminders being most effective but costliest. CONCLUSIONS: Patient reminder systems in primary care settings are effective in improving immunization rates. Primary care physicians should use patient reminders to improve immunization delivery.

BACKGROUND: Attempts to maintain or increase vaccination coverage almost all focus on supply side interventions: improving availability and delivery of vaccines. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of efforts to increase demand is uncertain. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies that provided quantitative estimates of the impact of demand side interventions on uptake of routine childhood vaccination. We retrieved studies published up to Sept 2008. RESULTS: The initial search retrieved 468 potentially eligible studies, including four systematic reviews and eight original studies of the impact of interventions to increase demand for vaccination. We identified only two randomised controlled trials. Interventions with an impact on vaccination uptake included knowledge translation (KT) (mass media, village resource rooms and community discussions) and non-KT initiatives (incentives, economic empowerment, household visits by extension workers). Most claimed to increase vaccine coverage by 20 to 30%. Estimates of the cost per vaccinated child varied considerably with several in the range of $10-20 per vaccinated child. CONCLUSION: Most studies reviewed here represented a low level of evidence. Mass media campaigns may be effective, but the impact depends on access to media and may be costly if run at a local level. The persistence of positive effects has not been investigated. The economics of demand side interventions have not been adequately assessed, but available data suggest that some may be very cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate controlled evidence on the impact of automated computer-based telephone messaging technology upon health outcomes, cost savings and acceptance by patients, caregivers and care providers. METHODS: Systematic searches of electronic databases were conducted to find controlled clinical studies of automated phone messaging used in patient care. Studies were selected based on the three criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials or controlled trials; 2) patients receiving health care related education, information, advice or reminder for a specific action to be taken in their home setting; and 3) use of automated computer-based phone technology to deliver the messages. Information abstracted from studies included information about the institution, persons targeted, intervention and its effect on health outcomes, costs and acceptance by patients and caregivers. RESULTS: A total of nineteen studies were identified for review. Sixteen studies were randomized controlled trials and three were controlled studies with no randomization. Studies were placed in two categories, preventive care education and chronic care studies. Preventive care education studies covered childhood immunizations, medication compliance, influenza vaccinations, tuberculosis and health prevention activities and chronic care studies were related to cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure. More than 80% of studies showed significant impact upon measurable health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Controlled evidence substantiates the efficacy of automated telephone communication in improving the quality of care. Educational voice messages are acceptable in patients and represent an important opportunity to enhance telemedicine and telehealth applications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Herd immunity is an important benefit of childhood immunization, but it is unknown if the concept of benefit to others influences parents' decisions to immunize their children. Our objective was to determine if the concept of "benefit to others" has been found in the literature to influence parents' motivation for childhood immunization. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline through October 2010 for articles on parental/guardian decision-making regarding child immunization. Studies were included if they presented original work, elicited responses from parents/guardians of children <18 years old, and addressed vaccinating children for the benefit of others. RESULTS: The search yielded 5876 titles; 91 articles were identified for full review. Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies identified benefit to others as 1 among several motivating factors for immunization by using interviews or focus groups. Nine studies included the concept of benefit to others in surveys but did not rank its relative importance. In 3 studies, the importance of benefit to others was ranked relative to other motivating factors. One to six percent of parents ranked benefit to others as their primary reason to vaccinate their children, and 37% of parents ranked benefit to others as their second most important factor in decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be some parental willingness to immunize children for the benefit of others, but its relative importance as a motivator is largely unknown. Further work is needed to explore this concept as a possible motivational tool for increasing childhood immunization uptake.

Reminders may help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting the doctor to recall information that they already know or would be expected to know and by providing information or guidance in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of reminders automatically generated through a computerized system and delivered on paper to healthcare professionals on processes of care (related to healthcare professionals' practice) and outcomes of care (related to patients' health condition). SEARCH METHODS: For this update the EPOC Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the following databases between June 11-19, 2012: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Library (Economics, Methods, and Health Technology Assessment sections), Issue 6, 2012; MEDLINE, OVID (1946- ), Daily Update, and In-process; EMBASE, Ovid (1947- ); CINAHL, EbscoHost (1980- ); EPOC Specialised Register, Reference Manager, and INSPEC, Engineering Village. The authors reviewed reference lists of related reviews and studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included individual or cluster-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) that evaluated the impact of computer-generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals on processes and/or outcomes of care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors working in pairs independently screened studies for eligibility and abstracted data. We contacted authors to obtain important missing information for studies that were published within the last 10 years. For each study, we extracted the primary outcome when it was defined or calculated the median effect size across all reported outcomes. We then calculated the median absolute improvement and interquartile range (IQR) in process adherence across included studies using the primary outcome or median outcome as representative outcome. MAIN RESULTS: In the 32 included studies, computer-generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals achieved moderate improvement in professional practices, with a median improvement of processes of care of 7.0% (IQR 3.9% to 16.4%). Implementing reminders alone improved care by 11.2% (IQR 6.5% to 19.6%) compared with usual care, while implementing reminders in addition to another intervention improved care by 4.0% only (IQR 3.0% to 6.0%) compared with the other intervention. The quality of evidence for these comparisons was rated as moderate according to the GRADE approach. Two reminder features were associated with larger effect sizes: providing space on the reminder for provider to enter a response (median 13.7% versus 4.3% for no response, P value = 0.01) and providing an explanation of the content or advice on the reminder (median 12.0% versus 4.2% for no explanation, P value = 0.02). Median improvement in processes of care also differed according to the behaviour the reminder targeted: for instance, reminders to vaccinate improved processes of care by 13.1% (IQR 12.2% to 20.7%) compared with other targeted behaviours. In the only study that had sufficient power to detect a clinically significant effect on outcomes of care, reminders were not associated with significant improvements. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence that computer-generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals achieve moderate improvement in process of care. Two characteristics emerged as significant predictors of improvement: providing space on the reminder for a response from the clinician and providing an explanation of the reminder’s content or advice. The heterogeneity of the reminder interventions included in this review also suggests that reminders can improve care in various settings under various conditions

Vaccination against disease is a powerful public health tool, and persuading people to be vaccinated is a correspondingly important challenge. A number of studies have compared the effectiveness of gain-framed and loss-framed appeals in this domain, often expecting gain-framed appeals to be more persuasive. A meta-analytic review (k = 32, N = 11,814), however, finds no significant difference in the persuasiveness of gain- and loss-framed appeals for encouraging vaccination. This conclusion is unaffected by differences in the phrasing of the outcomes invoked or by differences in the specific vaccination advocated. But the results contain a hint that parents might be more persuaded to vaccinate their children by loss-framed than by gain-framed appeals. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of strategies to optimize immunisation uptake within preschool children in developed countries. DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: Developed countries PARTICIPANTS: Preschool children who were due, or overdue, one or more of their routine primary immunisations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Increase in the proportion of the target population up to date with standard recommended universal vaccinations. RESULTS: Forty-six studies were included for analysis, published between 1980 and 2009. Twenty-six studies were randomized controlled trials, 11 were before and after trials, and nine were controlled intervention trials. Parental reminders showed a statistically significant increase in immunisation rates in 34% of included intervention arms. These effects were reported with both generic and specific reminders and with all methods of reminders and recall. Strategies aimed at immunisation providers were also shown to improve immunisation rates with a median change in immunisation rates of 7% when reminders were used, 8% when educational programmes were used and 19% when feedback programmes were used. CONCLUSION: General practitioners are uniquely positioned to influence parental decisions on childhood immunisation. A variety of strategies studied in primary care settings have been shown to improve immunisation rates, including parental and healthcare provider reminders.

OBJECTIVES: To update a 2004 systematic review of health care service use and health outcomes related to differences in health literacy level and interventions designed to improve these outcomes for individuals with low health literacy. Disparities in health outcomes and effectiveness of interventions among different sociodemographic groups were also examined. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE®, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, and the Educational Resources Information Center. For health literacy, we searched using a variety of terms, limited to English and studies published from 2003 to May 25, 2010. For numeracy, we searched from 1966 to May 25, 2010. REVIEW METHODS: We used standard Evidence-based Practice Center methods of dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, abstractions, quality ratings, and strength of evidence grading. We resolved disagreements by consensus. We evaluated whether newer literature was available for answering key questions, so we broadened our definition of health literacy to include numeracy and oral (spoken) health literacy. We excluded intervention studies that did not measure health literacy directly and updated our approach to evaluate individual study risk of bias and to grade strength of evidence. RESULTS: We included good- and fair-quality studies: 81 studies addressing health outcomes (reported in 95 articles including 86 measuring health literacy and 16 measuring numeracy, of which 7 measure both) and 42 studies (reported in 45 articles) addressing interventions. Differences in health literacy level were consistently associated with increased hospitalizations, greater emergency care use, lower use of mammography, lower receipt of influenza vaccine, poorer ability to demonstrate taking medications appropriately, poorer ability to interpret labels and health messages, and, among seniors, poorer overall health status and higher mortality. Health literacy level potentially mediates disparities between blacks and whites. The strength of evidence of numeracy studies was insufficient to low, limiting conclusions about the influence of numeracy on health care service use or health outcomes. Two studies suggested numeracy may mediate the effect of disparities on health outcomes. We found no evidence concerning oral health literacy and outcomes. Among intervention studies (27 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 2 cluster RCTs, and 13 quasi-experimental designs), the strength of evidence for specific design features was low or insufficient. However, several specific features seemed to improve comprehension in one or a few studies. The strength of evidence was moderate for the effect of mixed interventions on health care service use; the effect of intensive self-management inventions on behavior; and the effect of disease-management interventions on disease prevalence/severity. The effects of other mixed interventions on other health outcomes, including knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence, and quality of life, and costs were mixed; thus, the strength of evidence was insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The field of health literacy has advanced since the 2004 report. Future research priorities include justifying appropriate cutoffs for health literacy levels prior to conducting studies; developing tools that measure additional related skills, particularly oral (spoken) health literacy; and examining mediators and moderators of the effect of health literacy. Priorities in advancing the design features of interventions include testing novel approaches to increase motivation, techniques for delivering information orally or numerically, "work around" interventions such as patient advocates; determining the effective components of already-tested interventions; determining the cost-effectiveness of programs; and determining the effect of policy and practice interventions.

PURPOSE: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates remain below national targets. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of quality improvement interventions for increasing the rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations among community-dwelling adults. METHODS: We included randomized and nonrandomized studies with a concurrent control group. We estimated pooled odds ratios using random effects models, and used the Downs and Black tool to assess the quality of included studies. RESULTS: Most studies involved elderly primary care patients. Interventions were associated with improvements in the rates of any vaccination (111 comparisons in 77 studies, pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95% CI, 1.49-1.75), and influenza (93 comparisons, 65 studies, OR = 1.46, 95% CI, 1.35-1.57) and pneumococcal (58 comparisons, 35 studies, OR = 2.01, 95% CI, 1.72-2.3) vaccinations. Interventions that appeared effective were patient financial incentives (influenza only), audit and feedback (influenza only), clinician reminders, clinician financial incentives (influenza only), team change, patient outreach, delivery site changes (influenza only), clinician education (pneumococcus only), and case management (pneumococcus only). Patient outreach was more effective if personal contact was involved. Team changes were more effective where nurses administered influenza vaccinations independently. Heterogeneity in some pooled odds ratios was high, however, and funnel plots showed signs of potential publication bias. Study quality varied but was not associated with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement interventions, especially those that assign vaccination responsibilities to nonphysician personnel or that activate patients through personal contact, can modestly improve vaccination rates in community-dwelling adults. To meet national policy targets, more-potent interventions should be developed and evaluated.

BACKGROUND: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends influenza vaccinations for all children 6 months to 18 years of age, which includes school-aged children. Influenza immunization programs may benefit schools by reducing absenteeism. METHODS: A systematic literature review of PubMed, PsychLit, and Dissertation Abstracts available as of January 7, 2008, was conducted for school-located vaccinations, using search words "School Health Services" and "Immunization Programs"; limited to "Child" (6-12 years) and "Adolescent" (13-18 years) for PubMed and "mass or universal" and (immuniz<sup>*</sup> or immunis<sup>*</sup> or vaccin<sup>*</sup>) and (school or Child or Adolescen<sup>*</sup>) for PsychLit and Dissertation Abstracts. Fifty-nine studies met the criteria for review. RESULTS: Strategies such as incentives, education, the design of the consent form, and follow-up can increase parental consent and number of returned forms. Minimizing out-of-pocket cost, offering both the intramuscular (shot) and intranasal (nasal spray) vaccination, and using reminders can increase vaccination coverage among those whose parents consented. Finally, organization, communication, and planning can minimize the logistical challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Schools-based vaccination programs are a promising option for achieving the expanded ACIP recommendation; school-located vaccination programs are feasible and effective. Adhering to lessons from the peer-reviewed scientific literature may help public health officials and schools implement the expanded recommendation to provide the greatest benefit for the lowest cost. Given the potential benefits of the expanded recommendation, both directly to the vaccinated children and indirectly to the community, prospective, well-controlled trials to establish the cost-effectiveness of specific vaccination strategies should be high priorities for future research.

BACKGROUND: The Summit of Independent European Vaccination Experts (SIEVE) recommended in 2007 that efforts be made to improve healthcare workers' knowledge and beliefs about vaccines, and their attitudes towards them, to increase vaccination coverage. The aim of the study was to compile and analyze the areas of disagreement in the existing evidence about the relationship between healthcare workers' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines and their intentions to vaccinate the populations they serve. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in four electronic databases for studies published in any of seven different languages between February 1998 and June 2009. We included studies conducted in developed countries that used statistical methods to relate or associate the variables included in our research question. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of the studies and extracted their relevant characteristics. The data were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 2354 references identified in the initial search, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The diversity in the study designs and in the methods used to measure the variables made it impossible to integrate the results, and each study had to be assessed individually. All the studies found an association in the direction postulated by the SIEVE experts: among healthcare workers, higher awareness, beliefs that are more aligned with scientific evidence and more favorable attitudes toward vaccination were associated with greater intentions to vaccinate. All the studies included were cross-sectional; thus, no causal relationship between the variables was established. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that interventions aimed at improving healthcare workers' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines should be encouraged, and their impact on vaccination coverage should be assessed.

However, there are many children who do not receive the recommended vaccines because their parents do not know why vaccination is important, do not understand how, where or when to get their children vaccinated, disagree with vaccination as a public health measure, or have concerns about vaccine safety. Face to face interventions to inform or educate parents about routine childhood vaccination may improve vaccination rates and parental knowledge or understanding of vaccination. Such interventions may describe or explain the practical and logistical factors associated with vaccination, and enable parents to understand the meaning and relevance of vaccination for their family or community. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of face to face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination on immunisation uptake and parental knowledge. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to July 2012); EMBASE + Embase Classic (OvidSP) (1947 to July 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to July 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to July 2012); Global Health (CAB) (1910 to July 2012); Global Health Library (WHO) (searched July 2012); Google Scholar (searched September 2012), ISI Web of Science (searched September 2012) and reference lists of relevant articles. We searched for ongoing trials in The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched August 2012) and for grey literature in The Grey Literature Report and OpenGrey (searched August 2012). We also contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. There were no language or date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs evaluating the effects of face to face interventions delivered to individual parents or groups of parents to inform or educate about early childhood vaccination, compared with control or with another face to face intervention. Early childhood vaccines are all recommended routine childhood vaccines outlined by the World Health Organization, with the exception of human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) which is delivered to adolescents. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed database search results for inclusion. Grey literature searches were conducted and reviewed by a single author. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs and one cluster RCT involving a total of 2978 participants. Three studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries and four were conducted in high-income countries. The cluster RCT did not contribute usable data to the review. The interventions comprised a mix of single-session and multi-session strategies. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was low to very low and the studies were at moderate risk of bias overall. All these trials compared face to face interventions directed to individual parents with control. The three studies assessing the effect of a single-session intervention on immunisation status could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity. The overall result is uncertain because the individual study results ranged from no evidence of effect to a significant increase in immunisation. Two studies assessed the effect of a multi-session intervention on immunisation status. These studies were also not pooled due to heterogeneity and the result was very uncertain, ranging from a non-significant decrease in immunisation to no evidence of effect. The two studies assessing the effect of a face to face intervention on knowledge or understanding of vaccination were very uncertain and were not pooled as data from one study were skewed. However, neither study showed evidence of an effect on knowledge scores in the intervention group. Only one study measured the cost of a case management intervention. The estimated additional cost per fully immunised child for the intervention was approximately eight times higher than usual care. The review also considered the following secondary outcomes: intention to vaccinate child, parent experience of intervention, and adverse effects. No adverse effects related to the intervention were measured by any of the included studies, and there were no data on the other outcomes of interest. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence available is low quality and suggests that face to face interventions to inform or educate parents about childhood vaccination have little to no impact on immunisation status, or knowledge or understanding of vaccination. There is insufficient evidence to comment on the cost of implementing the intervention, parent intention to vaccinate, parent experience of the intervention, or adverse effects. Given the apparently limited effect of such interventions, it may be feasible and appropriate to incorporate communication about vaccination into a healthcare encounter, rather than conduct it as a separate activity.

Annual influenza vaccination rates among hospital healthcare workers (HCW) are almost universally low despite recommendations from WHO and public health authorities in many countries. To assist in the development of successful vaccination programmes, we reviewed studies where interventions aimed to increase the uptake of influenza vaccination among hospital HCW. We searched PUBMED from 1990 up to December 2011 for publications with predetermined search strategies and of pre-defined criteria for inclusion or exclusion. We evaluated a large number of 'intervention programmes' each employing one or more 'intervention components' or strategies, such as easy access to vaccine or educational activities, with the goal to raise influenza vaccine uptake rates in hospital HCW during one influenza season. Included studies reported results of intervention programmes and compared the uptake with the season prior to the intervention (historical control) or to another intervention programme within the same season that started from the same set of baseline activities. Twenty-five studies performed in eight countries met our selection criteria and described 45 distinct intervention programmes. Most studies used their own facility as historical control and evaluated only one season. The following elements were used in intervention programmes that increased vaccine uptake: provision of free vaccine, easy access to the vaccine (e.g. through mobile carts or on-site vaccination), knowledge and behaviour modification through educational activities and/or reminders and/or incentives, management or organizational changes, such as the assignment of personnel dedicated to the intervention programme, long-term implementation of the strategy, requiring active declination and mandatory immunization policies. The number of these components applied appeared to be proportional to the increase in uptake. If influenza uptake in hospital HCW is to be increased on sustained basis, hospital managers need to be committed to conduct a well-designed long-term intervention programme that includes a variety of co-ordinated managerial and organizational elements.

Unvaccinated individuals pose a public health threat to communities. Research has identified many factors associated with parental vaccine refusal and hesitancy toward childhood and adolescent immunizations. However, data on the effectiveness of interventions to address parental refusal are limited. We conducted a systematic review of four online databases to identify interventional studies. We used criteria recommended by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) for the quality assessment of studies. Intervention categories and outcomes were evaluated for each body of evidence and confidence in overall estimates of effect was determined. There is limited evidence to guide implementation of effective strategies to deal with the emerging threat of parental vaccine refusal. There is a need for appropriately designed, executed and evaluated intervention studies to address this gap in knowledge.

OBJECTIVE: To understand rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine acceptability and factors correlated with HPV vaccine acceptability. DESIGN: Meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies. DATA SOURCES: We used a comprehensive search strategy across multiple electronic databases with no date or language restrictions to locate studies that examined rates and/or correlates of HPV vaccine acceptability. Search keywords included vaccine, acceptability and all terms for HPV. REVIEW METHODS: We calculated mean HPV vaccine acceptability across studies. We conducted meta-analysis using a random effects model on studies reporting correlates of HPV vaccine acceptability. All studies were assessed for risk of bias. RESULTS: Of 301 identified studies, 29 were included. Across 22 studies (n=8360), weighted mean HPV vaccine acceptability=50.4 (SD 21.5) (100-point scale). Among 16 studies (n=5048) included in meta-analyses, perceived HPV vaccine benefits, anticipatory regret, partner thinks one should get vaccine and healthcare provider recommendation had medium effect sizes, and the following factors had small effect sizes on HPV vaccine acceptability: perceived HPV vaccine effectiveness, need for multiple shots, fear of needles, fear of side effects, supportive/accepting social environment, perceived risk/susceptibility to HPV, perceived HPV severity, number of lifetime sexual partners, having a current sex partner, non-receipt of hepatitis B vaccine, smoking cigarettes, history of sexually transmitted infection, HPV awareness, HPV knowledge, cost, logistical barriers, being employed and non-white ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Public health campaigns that promote positive HPV vaccine attitudes and awareness about HPV risk in men, and interventions to promote healthcare provider recommendation of HPV vaccination for boys and mitigate obstacles due to cost and logistical barriers may support HPV vaccine acceptability for men. Future investigations employing rigorous designs, including intervention studies, are needed to support effective HPV vaccine promotion among men.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically assess (i) the effects and safety and (ii) the acceptability of using lay health workers (LHWs) to deliver vaccines and medicines to mothers and children through compact pre-filled autodisable devices (CPADs). METHODS: We searched electronic databases and grey literature. For the systematic review of effects and safety, we sought randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies. For the systematic review of acceptability, we sought qualitative studies. Two researchers independently carried out data extraction, study quality assessment and thematic analysis of the qualitative data. RESULTS: No studies met our criteria for the review exploring the effects and safety of using LHWs to deliver CPADs. For the acceptability review, six qualitative studies assessed the acceptability of using LHWs to deliver hepatitis B vaccine, tetanus toxoid vaccine, gentamicin or oxytocin using Uniject™ devices. All studies took place in low- or middle-income countries and explored the perceptions of community members, LHWs, supervisors, health professionals or programme managers. Most of the studies were of low quality. Recipients generally accepted the intervention. Most health professionals were confident that LHWs could deliver the intervention with sufficient training and supervision, but some had problems delivering supervision. The LHWs perceived Uniject™ as effective and important and were motivated by positive responses from the community. However, some LHWs feared the consequences if harm should come to recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of the effects and safety of using CPADs delivered by LHWs is lacking. Evidence regarding acceptability suggests that this intervention may be acceptable although LHWs may feel vulnerable to blame.

BACKGROUND: Vaccination against influenza is considered the most important public health intervention to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and premature deaths related to influenza in the elderly, though there are significant inequities among global influenza vaccine resources, capacities, and policies. The objective of this study was to assess the social determinants of health preventing adults ≥ 65 years old from accessing and accepting seasonal influenza vaccination. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in January 2011 using MEDLINE, ISI - Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (1980-2011). Reference lists of articles were also examined. Selection criteria included qualitative and quantitative studies written in English that examined social determinants of and barriers against seasonal influenza vaccination among adults ≥ 65 years. Two authors performed the quality assessment and data extraction. Thematic analysis was the main approach for joint synthesis, using identification and juxtaposition of themes associated with vaccination. RESULTS: Overall, 58 studies were analyzed. Structural social determinants such as age, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity, socio-economic status, social and cultural values, as well as intermediary determinants including housing-place of residence, behavioral beliefs, social influences, previous vaccine experiences, perceived susceptibility, sources of information, and perceived health status influenced seasonal influenza vaccination. Healthcare system related factors including accessibility, affordability, knowledge and attitudes about vaccination, and physicians' advice were also important determinants of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the ability of adults ≥ 65 years to receive seasonal influenza vaccine is influenced by structural, intermediate, and healthcare-related social determinants which have an impact at the health system, provider, and individual levels.

Never heard of it!": a systematic review of girls' and parents' information needs, views and preferences about human papillomavirus vaccination.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Two human papillomavirus vaccines were licenced in 2006/2007 for cervical cancer prevention. National vaccination programmes for schoolgirls were subsequently introduced in some European countries, North America and Australia. To understand factors influencing vaccine uptake and to inform the development of appropriate UK educational materials, we aimed to synthesise evidence of girls' and parents' information needs, views and preferences regarding HPV vaccination. DESIGN: Systematic review and mixed method synthesis of qualitative and survey data. DATA SOURCES: Twelve electronic databases; bibliographies of included studies 1980 to August 2011. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened papers and appraised study quality. Studies were synthesised collaboratively using framework methods for qualitative data, and survey results integrated where they supported, contrasted or added to the themes identified. RESULTS: Twenty-eight qualitative studies and 44 surveys were included. Where vaccination was offered, uptake was high. Intention to decline was related to a preference for vaccinating later to avoid appearing to condone early sexual activity, concerns about vaccine safety and low perception of risk of HPV infection. Knowledge was poor and there were many misconceptions; participants tried to assess the potential benefits and harms of vaccination but struggled to interpret limited information about HPV in the context of existing knowledge about sexually transmitted infections and cancer. Conclusion Many girls and their parents have limited understanding to an extent that impinges on their ability to make informed choices about HPV vaccination and could impact on future uptake of cervical screening. This is a considerable challenge to those who design and provide information, but getting the messages right for this programme could help in developing patient information about other HPV related cancers.

The authors conducted a systematic review that aimed to map current practice and identify effective practice in promotional communications for seasonal influenza vaccination in Europe. They identified 22 studies from 7 European countries. Included studies were primarily outcome evaluations of communications promoting vaccination to health care workers and elderly adults. Evidence on communications to improve public acceptance was sparse. A range of communication approaches, methods, materials, and channels were used, frequently in combination. All forms of promotional communications have the potential to increase uptake in health care workers and can also improve uptake among patients. There was promising evidence that mass communication methods, delivered as standalone activities or as one component of a communication mix, can improve uptake in target populations. Education for health care workers and improved service delivery are common adjuncts to promotional communications that were associated with effectiveness. The evidence suggests that personalized communications, combined with improved service delivery, might boost rates of uptake among elderly adults. Future development of good practice could be enhanced by more systematic, theory-based intervention design and more detailed reporting of process and outcome evaluations. Vaccine hesitancy is increasingly prevalent; more policy and research to improve public acceptance should therefore be considered.

School-based vaccination is becoming a more widely considered method of delivering HPV immunizations to an adolescent population; however, many countries do not have experience with delivering adolescent vaccines or school-based programs. This literature review will summarize the experiences from countries implementing non-health facility-based and health facility-based vaccination programs and assess HPV vaccine coverage. In October 2012, a systematic search in PubMed for studies related to the evaluation of national/regional, pilot, or demonstration HPV immunization programs that worked within existing health system yielded nine articles, representing seventeen countries. School-based programs achieved high HPV vaccination coverage rates in 9 to 13-year-old girls across the different studies and geographic locations, suggesting non-health facility-based programs are possible for HPV vaccine introduction. Grade-based, compared to age-based, eligibility criteria may be easier to implement in school settings. More studies are needed to explore the methods to standardize estimates for HPV vaccine coverage so that programs can be appropriately evaluated.

BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes a considerable amount of morbidity and mortality in children <5. However, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) can prevent much of this burden. Until recently, PCVs were mostly available only in developed countries using a variety of dosing schedules. As more lower income countries make decisions to introduce PCV into their national immunization programs, an optimal schedule with which to administer PCV has become a key policy question. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of English literature published from 1994 to 2010 on the effects of PCV dosing schedules on immunogenicity, nasopharyngeal carriage, invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. Data were independently double abstracted and cleaned for analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS: We identified 12,980 citations from the literature search (12,976) and secondary means (44). Double review of titles and abstracts yielded 769 articles that underwent full data abstraction. Of these, 350 were further analyzed and are presented in separate reports in this supplement. CONCLUSIONS: This article presents the methods utilized in our systematic review. Because of the heterogenity of the study methods of the reports identified by this review, we did not conduct formal meta-analyses. However, these methods allow us to present a full landscape of the literature on PCV dosing schedules.
b755266933b3901c53e01e3739d941d385c4adb6			A systematic review of the evidence for incentive schemes to encourage positive health and other social behaviours in young people	What do we want to know? There is considerable and growing, interest in the possibility that providing direct incentives of one kind or another can encourage healthy behaviours. This systematic review brings together the relevant research literature to examine the impact of single or dual component incentives schemes in encouraging positive health and other social behaviours in young people aged 11-19. It also examines ongoing incentive-based schemes in more detail. Who wants to know? Policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, young people. What did we find? Overall incentive schemes do not offer a simple route to ensuring general positive behaviour changes in young people. However, they may be useful in particular settings and for particular groups. There is evidence that non-financial incentives are effective in encouraging teenage mothers to attend an early post-natal health clinic. We found no evidence that simple incentive schemes are effective in improving either young peoples levels of effort applied to educational tests or attendance levels in school. Incentives are effective in reducing smoking behaviours in the context of school-based competitions. These findings were based on a small number of non-UK studies, and should be interpreted with caution. Simple incentives schemes may be more effective where a simple or single action is required, rather than a sustained positive health behaviour change. What are the implications? Incentive schemes to promote the uptake of simple or single event preventive health behaviours in young people should be designed and piloted. These schemes could include immunisation or health screening programmes, and accessing pre- and post-natal health services. Classroom-based incentive schemes which aim to delay the onset of or reduce levels of smoking should be piloted and evaluated in well-designed randomised controlled trials. Future incentive schemes should access, and take into account, the views of young people on important areas of behaviour change, and what types of incentive-based interventions might be acceptable to them. This is an essential first step in designing and implementing acceptable and effective interventions. Future evaluation research in this area should prioritise the use of randomised controlled trials. All evaluations should be accompanied by well-designed process evaluations. Those conducting publicly funded incentive schemes should be encouraged to conduct reliable evaluations of the interventions that they implement with young people. How did we get these results? The results of sixteen trials and seven process evaluations were synthesised to yield the best evidence currently available about the role of incentive schemes in promoting young people's well-being.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Education of individuals who are at risk for, or have been diagnosed with, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections can improve their participation in disease management. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effects of educational interventions for patients with HBV or HCV infections. METHODS: We searched multiple databases for peer-reviewed studies of individuals with HBV or HCV infection, or those at risk for infection. Our final analysis included 14 studies that evaluated any educational intervention and reported the effectiveness or patient outcomes relevant to the intervention (7 patients with HCV infection, 4 patients with HBV infection, and 3 patients with either). Data extracted from studies included details on educational interventions, patient populations, comparison groups, and outcome measures. The quality of each study was appraised. RESULTS: Types of educational interventions assessed ranged from information websites and nurse-led sessions to community-wide and institutional programs. The educational interventions showed significant (P < .05) improvements to patients' knowledge about their disease, behaviors (including testing and uptake of vaccination), willingness to commence and adhere to treatment, and other outcomes such as self-efficacy and vitality or energy scores. These significant benefits were shown in 5 of 7 studies of HBV infection and 8 of 10 studies of HCV infection. On a 20-point quality scale, study scores ranged from 6 to 19. CONCLUSIONS: Simple educational interventions for patients with HBV or HCV infection significantly increase patients' knowledge about their disease. More complex, multimodal educational interventions seem to cause behavioral changes that increase rates of testing, vaccination (for HBV), and treatment.

Evidence Base The authors include 25 studies in this review, of which 13 took place in Latin America and the Caribbean, eight in Sub-Saharan Africa and four in South Asia. Of the studies, 48 percent assess cash-transfer programmes (41 percent conditional cash-transfer programmes and 7 percent unconditional cash-transfer programmes), 22 percent assess the effects of removing user fees and 25 percent assess microcredit programmes. In terms of child health coverage indicators, 12 studies look at vaccination coverage, 19 studies look at health-care use, four studies look at the management of diarrhoeal diseases, four studies look at other preventive health and three studies look at breastfeeding practices. Implications for policy and practice Breastfeeding practices: Financial incentives can have a positive impact on some breastfeeding practices. Evidence from two studies in Bolivia and Ghana shows that microcredit programmes conditional on participation of mothers in health and nutrition education lead to a 22 percent increase in new-born babies receiving colostrum, on average (mean risk difference [MD] = 0.22; 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.35). However, two studies of conditional and unconditional microcredit interventions in Honduras and Ecuador found no significant effects on prevalence of breastfeeding. The overall size and quality of the evidence base is low.Vaccination coverage: Evidence from conditional cash-transfer and conditional microcredit programmes shows no impact on vaccination coverage, specifically BCG, DPT-1, DPT-3, measles or polio. Evidence from four conditional cash-transfer programmes suggests that these programmes may increase coverage of full age-appropriate vaccination, but the average effect is not statistically significant (MD = 0.05; CI: −0.01, 0.10). The available evidence base is only of moderate to low quality. Use of preventative health care: Evidence from five conditional cash-transfer programmes shows a 14 percent increase, on average, in the use of preventive health care by children under the age of five (MD = 0.14; CI: −0.00, 0.29), though the average effect is not statistically significant. The authors also note that the effects vary across studies and the evidence is of variable quality. Removal of user fees lead to a 33 percent increase in the prevalence of health-care use, on average (MD = 0.33; CI: 0.24, 0.43), and a 99 percent increase in the frequency of health-care use, on average (MD = 0.99; CI: 0.71, 1.27)—but, again, the quality of evidence is low.Management of child diarrhoea: The evidence for the impact of financial-incentive programmes on management of childhood diarrhoea is poor, with only single studies looking at the impact of either unconditional or conditional microcredit on use of oral rehydration or care-seeking during diarrhoea. Two studies of conditional microcredit interventions suggest no effect of the intervention on the practice of continuing child feeding during diarrhoea. Other preventative health care: Evidence from two conditional cash-transfer programmes finds a 16 percent increase in the average coverage of Vitamin A supplements, but the results are not statistically significant (MD = 0.16; CI: −0.01, 0.34). Implications for further research The review team calls for future systematic reviews to assess the impact of financial incentives on child morbidity and mortality. They also state that future primary research should try to isolate the effects of the financial and non-financial components of programmes. BACKGROUND: Financial incentives that provide direct or indirect monetary incentives to households, such as voucher schemes or cash-transfer programmes, are commonly used to help overcome poverty and improve health of populations in low- and middle-income countries. One channel by which they are expected to do this is through the removal of financial barriers to health care. This is expected to improve access, uptake and coverage of health services such as immunisation, treatment of diarrhoea and preventative health interventions. Previous reviews have looked at the impact of different types of financial incentives on health outcomes. However, this is the first review to comprehensively review the effectiveness of financial-incentive programmes in low- and middle-income countries targeted at the coverage and uptake of health services and behaviours of children under the age of five. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to investigate the effects of six different types of financial-incentive programmes—unconditional cash transfers, conditional cash transfers, unconditional microcredit, conditional microcredit, unconditional voucher, conditional voucher and user-fee removal—on uptake and coverage of health interventions for children under the age of five. METHODOLOGY: The authors included randomised controlled trials, cluster-randomised controlled trials and observational studies that assessed the effect of financial incentives on indicators of health-care coverage for children under the age of five. Eligible studies reported the effect of financial incentives on the following types of health-coverage outcomes: breastfeeding, vaccination, health-care use, diarrhoeal diseases and other preventive health interventions. The authors used the Child Health Evaluation Reference Group (CHERG) systematic review guidelines and searched for studies published in either peer-reviewed journals or institutional/commissioned reports covering the period up to 1 September 2012. They searched in the databases PubMed, EMBASE and AMED and used Google Scholar and the Microfinance Gateway library to complement this search. They assessed the quality of the included studies and used meta-analysis to synthesise effect sizes.

BACKGROUND: The Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been available for protection against HPV-associated cervical cancer and genital warts since 2006. Nonetheless, uptake has varied among countries and populations within countries. Studies have found that individuals' knowledge and attitudes toward the vaccine are associated with immunization uptake. The purpose of the current review is to summarize and evaluate the evidence for educational interventions to increase HPV vaccination acceptance. METHODS: We searched the databases of PubMed and Web of Science for English-language articles describing educational interventions designed to improve HPV vaccination uptake, intention or attitude. RESULTS: We identified 33 studies of HPV vaccination educational interventions: 7 tested the effectiveness of interventions with parents, 8 with adolescents or young adults, and 18 compared the effectiveness of different message frames in an educational intervention among adolescents, young adults or their parents. Most studies involved populations with higher educational attainment and most interventions required participants to be literate. The minority of studies used the outcome of HPV vaccine uptake. Well-designed studies adequately powered to detect change in vaccine uptake were rare and generally did not demonstrate effectiveness of the tested intervention. CONCLUSIONS: There is not strong evidence to recommend any specific educational intervention for wide-spread implementation. Future studies are required to determine the effectiveness of culturally-competent interventions reaching diverse populations.

Vaccine "hesitancy" is an emerging term in the literature and discourse on vaccine decision-making and determinants of vaccine acceptance. It recognizes a continuum between the domains of vaccine acceptance and vaccine refusal and de-polarizes previous characterization of individuals and groups as either anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine. The primary aims of this systematic review are to: 1) identify research on vaccine hesitancy; 2) identify determinants of vaccine hesitancy in different settings including its context-specific causes, its expression and its impact; and 3) inform the development of a model for assessing determinants of vaccine hesitancy in different settings as proposed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Working Group (SAGE WG) for dealing with vaccine hesitancy. A broad search strategy, built to capture multiple dimensions of public trust, confidence and hesitancy around vaccines, was applied across multiple databases. Peer-reviewed studies were selected for inclusion if they focused on childhood vaccines [≤ 7 years of age], used multivariate analyses, and were published between January 2007 and November 2012. Our results show a variety of factors as being associated with vaccine hesitancy but they do not allow for a complete classification and confirmation of their independent and relative strength of influence. Determinants of vaccine hesitancy are complex and context-specific - varying across time, place and vaccines.

IMPORTANCE: Since licensure of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2006, HPV vaccine coverage among US adolescents has increased but remains low compared with other recommended vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on barriers to HPV vaccination among US adolescents to inform future efforts to increase HPV vaccine coverage. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed and previous review articles to identify original research articles describing barriers to HPV vaccine initiation and completion among US adolescents. Only articles reporting data collected in 2009 or later were included. Findings from 55 relevant articles were summarized by target populations: health care professionals, parents, underserved and disadvantaged populations, and males. FINDINGS: Health care professionals cited financial concerns and parental attitudes and concerns as barriers to providing the HPV vaccine to patients. Parents often reported needing more information before vaccinating their children. Concerns about the vaccine's effect on sexual behavior, low perceived risk of HPV infection, social influences, irregular preventive care, and vaccine cost were also identified as potential barriers among parents. Some parents of sons reported not vaccinating their sons because of the perceived lack of direct benefit. Parents consistently cited health care professional recommendations as one of the most important factors in their decision to vaccinate their children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Continued efforts are needed to ensure that health care professionals and parents understand the importance of vaccinating adolescents before they become sexually active. Health care professionals may benefit from guidance on communicating HPV recommendations to patients and parents. Further efforts are also needed to reduce missed opportunities for HPV vaccination when adolescents interface with the health care system. Efforts to increase uptake should take into account the specific needs of subgroups within the population. Efforts that address system-level barriers to vaccination may help to increase overall HPV vaccine uptake.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer, HPV and HPV vaccine, and willingness and acceptability to vaccinate in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. We further identified countries that fulfill the two GAVI Alliance eligibility criteria to support nationwide HPV vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies on the knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer, HPV and HPV vaccine, and willingness and acceptability to vaccinate. Trends in Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine coverage in SSA countries from 1990-2011 were extracted from the World Health Organization database. FINDINGS: The review revealed high levels of willingness and acceptability of HPV vaccine but low levels of knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer, HPV or HPV vaccine. We identified only six countries to have met the two GAVI Alliance requirements for supporting introduction of HPV vaccine: 1) the ability to deliver multi-dose vaccines for no less than 50% of the target vaccination cohort in an average size district, and 2) achieving over 70% coverage of DTP3 vaccine nationally. From 2008 through 2011 all SSA countries, with the exception of Mauritania and Nigeria, have reached or maintained DTP3 coverage at 70% or above. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for more education to inform the public about HPV, HPV vaccine, and cervical cancer, particularly to key demographics, (adolescents, parents and healthcare professionals), to leverage high levels of willingness and acceptability of HPV vaccine towards successful implementation of HPV vaccination programs. There is unpreparedness in most SSA countries to roll out national HPV vaccination as per the GAVI Alliance eligibility criteria for supporting introduction of the vaccine. In countries that have met 70% DTP3 coverage, pilot programs need to be rolled out to identify the best practice and strategies for delivering HPV vaccines to adolescents and also to qualify for GAVI Alliance support.

BACKGROUND: Financial incentive interventions have been suggested as one method of promoting healthy behaviour change. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of financial incentive interventions for encouraging healthy behaviour change; to explore whether effects vary according to the type of behaviour incentivised, post-intervention follow-up time, or incentive value. DATA SOURCES: Searches were of relevant electronic databases, research registers, www.google.com, and the reference lists of previous reviews; and requests for information sent to relevant mailing lists. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Controlled evaluations of the effectiveness of financial incentive interventions, compared to no intervention or usual care, to encourage healthy behaviour change, in non-clinical adult populations, living in high-income countries, were included. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess all included studies. Meta-analysis was used to explore the effect of financial incentive interventions within groups of similar behaviours and overall. Meta-regression was used to determine if effect varied according to post-intervention follow up time, or incentive value. RESULTS: Seventeen papers reporting on 16 studies on smoking cessation (n = 10), attendance for vaccination or screening (n = 5), and physical activity (n = 1) were included. In meta-analyses, the average effect of incentive interventions was greater than control for short-term (≤ six months) smoking cessation (relative risk (95% confidence intervals): 2.48 (1.77 to 3.46); long-term (>six months) smoking cessation (1.50 (1.05 to 2.14)); attendance for vaccination or screening (1.92 (1.46 to 2.53)); and for all behaviours combined (1.62 (1.38 to 1.91)). There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours. Meta-regression found some, limited, evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased. However, the latter effect may be confounded by the former. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change.

CONTEXT:: Immunizations are the most effective way to reduce incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. Immunization information systems (IISs) are confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all vaccination doses administered by participating providers to people residing within a given geopolitical area. They facilitate consolidation of vaccination histories for use by health care providers in determining appropriate client vaccinations. Immunization information systems also provide aggregate data on immunizations for use in monitoring coverage and program operations and to guide public health action. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION:: Methods for conducting systematic reviews for the Guide to Community Preventive Services were used to assess the effectiveness of IISs. Reviewed evidence examined changes in vaccination rates in client populations or described expanded IIS capabilities related to improving vaccinations. The literature search identified 108 published articles and 132 conference abstracts describing or evaluating the use of IISs in different assessment categories. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:: Studies described or evaluated IIS capabilities to (1) create or support effective interventions to increase vaccination rates, such as client reminder and recall, provider assessment and feedback, and provider reminders; (2) determine client vaccination status to inform decisions by clinicians, health care systems, and schools; (3) guide public health responses to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease; (4) inform assessments of vaccination coverage, missed vaccination opportunities, invalid dose administration, and disparities; and (5) facilitate vaccine management and accountability. CONCLUSIONS:: Findings from 240 articles and abstracts demonstrate IIS capabilities and actions in increasing vaccination rates with the goal of reducing vaccine-preventable disease.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

CONTEXT:: A recent systematic review found that use of an immunization information system (IIS) is an effective intervention to increase vaccination rates. The purpose of this review was to evaluate costs and benefits associated with implementing, operating, and participating with an IIS. The speed of technology change has had an effect on costs and benefits of IIS and is considered in this review. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION:: An economic evaluation for IIS was conducted using methods developed for Community Guide systematic reviews. The literature search covered the period from January 1994 to March 2012 and identified 12 published articles and 2 government reports. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:: Most studies involving cost data evaluated (1) system costs of building an IIS and (2) cost of exchanging immunization data; most economic benefits focused on administrative efficiency. CONCLUSIONS:: A major challenge to evaluating a technology-based intervention is the evolution that comes with technology improvements and advancements. Although the cost and benefit data may be less applicable today due to changes in system technology, data exchange methods, availability of vendor support, system functionalities, and scope of IIS, it is likely that more up-to-date estimates and comprehensive estimates of benefits would support the findings of cost savings in this review. More research is needed to update and address limitations in the available evidence and to enable assessment of economic costs and benefits of present-day IIS.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

OBJECTIVES: The review aimed to assess the effectiveness of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in improving child health in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched for papers: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, PsychINFO, BIOSIS Previews, Academic Search Complete, and CSA Sociological Abstracts. The included studies comprised of randomised controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies evaluating the impact of CCTs on child health. Due to the substantial heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative synthesis was conducted on the extracted data. RESULTS: Sixteen studies predominantly from Latin American countries met the inclusion criteria. The outcomes reported by the studies in relation to CCTs' effectiveness in improving child health were reduction in morbidity risk, improvement in nutritional outcomes, health services utilisation, and immunisation coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that to a large extent, CCTs are effective in improving child health by addressing child health determinants such as access to health care, child and maternal nutrition, morbidity risk, immunisation coverage, and household poverty in developing countries particularly middle-income countries. Of importance to both policy and practice, it appears that CCTs require effective functioning of health care systems to effectively promote child health.
01d1f4b0d1de0e20e364d9269d5e09aa658fb370			Systematic literature review of the evidence for effective national immunisation schedule promotional communications	INTRODUCTION: A systematic literature review examined the published evidence on the effectiveness of European promotional communications for national immunisation schedule (NIS) vaccinations. The review was commissioned by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and conducted by the Institute for Social Marketing at the University of Stirling. The purpose of the review: ‘Immunisation hesitancy' has negatively impacted population uptake of routine immunisation. A substantial body of evaluated communication activity promoting nationally indicated routine immunisation has been published. This systematic review of the evidence aims to: collate and map the types of promotional communication that have been used; assess the quality of the evaluative research reporting on these promotional communications; and assess the applicability of this evidence to immunisation policy, strategy and practice priorities. The analysis and findings are intended to provide a current status report on the evidence, and evidence gaps for good practice in national immunisation promotional communications, thus supporting countries in their communication activities for the prevention and control of communicable diseases. OBJECTIVES OF THE REVIEW: The review aimed to answer the following research questions: * Which audiences have been targeted by NIS promotional communications? * Which communication methods and approaches have been used to promote or reinforce NIS vaccination uptake? * What theoretical underpinnings are used to inform communication methods and approaches? * Which settings and communication channels have been used to promote or reinforce NIS vaccination uptake? * What is the evidence for effectiveness of communication initiatives in changing or reinforcing knowledge, attitudes or behaviour towards NIS? * What is the evidence for impact of NIS communication initiatives to control communicable disease? * What impact have campaign communications promoting NIS had on public acceptance and vaccine uptake rates?

BACKGROUND: Pregnant women have the highest priority for seasonal influenza vaccine. However, suboptimal coverage has been repeatedly noted in this population. To improve vaccine uptake, reviewing the determinants of vaccination is of increasing importance. METHODS: A detailed literature search was performed up to November 30, 2013 to retrieve articles related to uptake of influenza vaccination during pregnancy. RESULTS: Forty-five research papers were included in the review. Twenty-one studies assessed the coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination, 13 studies assessed coverage of A/H1N1 pandemic vaccination and 11 studies assessed both. Vaccination uptake ranged from 1.7% to 88.4% for seasonal influenza, and from 6.2% to 85.7% for A/H1N1 pandemic influenza. Many pregnant women were unaware that they were at high risk for influenza and its complications during pregnancy. They were also more likely to underestimate the threat of influenza to themselves and their fetus. Moreover, they had substantial concerns about the safety and efficacy of the influenza vaccine during pregnancy. Negative media reports contributed to the perception that influenza vaccination during pregnancy was risky and could result in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although health care providers' (HCPs) recommendations were consistently associated with vaccine uptake, most did not recommend the vaccine to their pregnant clients. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination uptake among pregnant women is suboptimal and HCPs rarely recommend it. Positive vaccination recommendations from HCPs as well as direct access to the vaccine would likely substantially improve vaccination acceptance.

OBJECTIVES: To assess access, provider, system and societal interventions to increase the uptake of influenza vaccination in people aged 60 years and older in the community. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 1950 to May week 3 2014), EMBASE (1980 to June 2014), AgeLine (1978 to 4 June 2014), ERIC (1965 to June 2014) and CINAHL (1982 to June 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to increase influenza vaccination uptake in people aged 60 and older. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted influenza vaccine uptake data. MAIN RESULTS: This update identified 13 new RCTs; the review now includes a total of 57 RCTs with 896,531 participants. The trials included community-dwelling seniors in high-income countries. Heterogeneity limited meta-analysis. The percentage of trials with low risk of bias for each domain was as follows: randomisation (33%); allocation concealment (11%); blinding (44%); missing data (49%) and selective reporting (100%). The interventions with a statistically significant result were: three trials (n = 64,200) of letter plus leaflet/postcard compared to letter (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.15); two trials (n = 614) of nurses/pharmacists educating plus vaccinating patients (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.91 to 5.66); single trials of a phone call from a senior (n = 193) (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.79 to 6.22), a telephone invitation versus clinic drop-in (n = 243) (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.55 to 4.76), a free groceries lottery (n = 291) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.76) and nurses educating and vaccinating patients (n = 485) (OR 152.95, 95% CI 9.39 to 2490.67). We did not pool the following trials due to considerable heterogeneity: postcard/letter/pamphlets (16 trials, n = 592,165); tailored communications (16 trials, n = 388,164); customised letter/phone-call (four trials, n = 82,465) and client-based appraisals (three trials, n = 4016), although several trials showed the interventions were effective. The interventions with a statistically significant result were: two trials (n = 2112) of home visits compared to clinic invitation (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.61); two trials (n = 2251) of free vaccine (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.98 to 2.82) and one trial (n = 321) of patient group visits (OR 24.85, 95% CI 1.45 to 425.32). One trial (n = 350) of a home visit plus vaccine encouragement compared to a home visit plus safety advice was non-significant. We did not pool the following trials due to considerable heterogeneity: nurse home visits (two trials, n = 2069) and free vaccine compared to no intervention (two trials, n = 2250). The interventions with a statistically significant result were: two trials (n = 2815) of paying physicians (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.77); one trial (n = 316) of reminding physicians about all their patients (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.99); one trial (n = 8376) of posters plus postcards (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.22); one trial (n = 1360) of chart review/feedback (OR 3.43, 95% CI 2.37 to 4.97) and one trial (n = 27,580) of educational outreach/feedback (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81). Trials of posters plus postcards versus posters (n = 5753), academic detailing (n = 1400) and increasing staff vaccination rates (n = 26,432) were non-significant. We did not pool the following trials due to considerable heterogeneity: reminding physicians (four trials, n = 202,264) and practice facilitators (three trials, n = 2183), although several trials showed the interventions were effective. We identified no RCTs of interventions at the societal level. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are interventions that are effective for increasing community demand for vaccination, enhancing access and improving provider/system response. Heterogeneity limited pooling of trials.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a narrative review of the impact of provider-based, organizational strategies in acute care settings to improve pneumococcal vaccination rates among patients over 65, and 2-64 years with high risk medical conditions. METHODS: A search was conducted using MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science databases for hospital-based, inpatient studies which evaluated strategies to improve pneumococcal vaccination rates. Studies published in English from 1983 to 2013 were included. Data abstracted was analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies were included; 15 evaluated physician reminders (e.g. chart or paper reminders, pre-printed orders (PPOs), computerized reminders, checklists) and 21 standing orders programs (SOPs). The most common study design was pre/post, and only 7 studies had a control group. Overall, 32 studies showed improvements in the rate of pneumococcal vaccination following intervention (19 statistically significant), with reminders showing 29-74% immunization rate, PPCO 5-42%, and SOPs 3.4-78%. CONCLUSION: Hospital-based interventions improve pneumococcal vaccination in older adults and younger individuals at risk. Although this review found that more success was observed with SOPs the impact on immunization rates in eligible patients varied significantly. Thus, high quality, randomized-controlled studies are required to determine the effect of each type of institutional immunization strategy.
